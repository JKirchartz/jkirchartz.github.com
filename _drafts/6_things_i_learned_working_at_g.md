In remembrance of my time of working at Google, and since it's peak listicle season, here are

#Six things I learned working at Google.

#/#6 Graceful Failure
Failures need to be investigated so you can learn from them and avoid making the same mistake in the future.
Any time you create a program there are eventually going to be human errors; perhaps a cavalcade of human errors.
Firing the developer for a bug after code-review and QA approved their work isn't going to fix the problem.
If there's an error in the workflow that causes people to step on each other's toes or causes any other stress for the team it needs to be discussed to avoid repeating the same problem in the future.
Learn from your mistakes, don't just find a scapegoat and shrug, fix it.
If somebody made a mistake they might not have even known, it's just not possible to know everything software's going to face in the real world.
Nothing is perfect its first time out, it need to me improved upon iteratively, and nothing needs to be set in stone until it is guaranteed to work.


#\#5 I didn't work for Google
I was a contractor, I was not a Google employee, I did not work for Google.
It's part of their orientation. I worked "at" and very specifically not "for" them.
As a contractor I worked for some staffing agency, so I cannot legally claim to have worked for Google even though they paid me (by proxy) and use my work.


#\#4 The Caste System is awkward
There's FTEs, Interns, then there's TVCs (Temps, Vendors, Contractors) - each gets a different colored badge.
FTEs get to drink beers, ride scooters, invite guests, go to off-site events, special talks, and travel.
TVCs get none of that, for legal reason, if there's not enough FTEs interested in a big talk then TVCs are invited to fill seats.
At every single event that the entire office *was* invited to another TVC would ask if we were allowed to be there.
We were never expelled, but it was always awkward.


#\#3 All meetings need an Agenda
Meetings need itineraries &amp; start/end times, and people need to stick to them.
Creating an agenda for a meeting in a shared doc allows everybody to put a blurb/links to their issues to discuss during the meeting.
A meeting can go 5 minutes over, but shouldn't go much further, schedule additional meetings if more discussion is required.
This agenda can even be edited any time during the meeting if something that warrants further discussion comes up.
It's great for avoiding bad meeting formats like "Random Story Time" or "Pages of Numbers."
The agenda keeps meetings from being a waste of time, if you want to waste time schedule a "Sync Up" meeting with a small group and enjoy.


#\#2 Google isn't magic
Google is pretty much like every other company on the planet;
They make a bunch of neat tools to use, but don't have anything super special to prevent problems with clients, communication, workflow, or staffing.
Managers and teams have opportunities to discuss and modify how things work for them, everybody has their own style.
There was no trick questions at my interview, they had me do FizzBuzz and some regexes.
If there is any ubiquitous mojo, it's that they have all the resources anybody could ever want.


#\#1 It's just business
As a contractor, I had a pretty good idea of when a year contract would expire, but I didn't know if it'd be renewed or not.
I was mistaken in-so-much as my "year" contract was only scheduled to last 11 months, ending a little over a month before Christmas.
I'd seen contractors leave, and some return; so I wasn't sure what was going to happen.
During my last 2 weeks the word was funding for the next year wasn't determined yet so my contract would not be renewed.
My last week I received applause and gratitude for my work in our regular meetings.
Not two weeks after my contract ended another staffing firm contacted me for the same position, this time paying a little over of half what I was making before.
