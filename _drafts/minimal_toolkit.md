[This minimalist site](http://tools.jkirchartz.com/) provides tools for URL shortening, URI encoding and decoding, choosing a random color, converting commas to tabs or vice versa, and escaping regex for use in javascript, all in a single html page.
There are plenty of online tools that could fulfill your needs, unfortunately the site's design may take the backseat, and there may be many pageloads and other scripts. This toolbox only has the tools you need without the cruft.

Not only is it minimalist design, but the code is minimalistic as well.
Each tool consists of a [form and a short script](view-source:http://tools.jkirchartz.com/), and the page itself uses another small bit of javascript to handle navigation.
