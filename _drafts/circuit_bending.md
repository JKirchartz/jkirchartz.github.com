Circuit Bending


How To Circuit Bend
Supplies: Soldering Iron, X-acto knife, solder-sucker/desoldering mesh,  Pen/Paper, Possibly a Camera; pile of potentiometers, resistors, wires (preferably with aligator clips on the end), patience

1. Power up (with batteries, never wall power)
    There's 2 things to test in the power section:
    1.a) if putting a drain on the input voltage makes interesting effects (e.g. Battery Dying effects)
    1.b) if connecting other points to the negative/ground terminal makes interesting effects
2. Poke around (with slightly damp fingers or aligator leads)
    2.a) if it sounds good with a wet finger, it may work well as a contact point (2 bare electrodes you can touch) or with a certain resistance (aligator leads with a potentiometer between them)
    2.b) if it sounds good with just the aligator clips/wire it may be well suited for a switch
    3. try switches, potentiometers, CdS sensors, etc.
4. Make it permanent - or not
    Not all bends are stable, some can produce unwanted errors or damage your device in the long-run.
