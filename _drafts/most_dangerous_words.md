In 2014 there were a few people talking about how ["Just"][1] is [the most
dangerous word in software development][2], Brad Frost (who wrote the first link in this sentence) says:

> I feel like an idiot while doing my job. A lot.
>
> Now there’s a damn good chance I’m actually an idiot, but the self-respecting
> part of me wants to challenge that notion.
>
> &hellip; one word in all those proffered solutions tends to stick out in my
> mind like a jagged, rusty nail ready to figuratively jam itself into my eye
> socket.
>
> “Just…”
>
> As in “Just update your ruby gems, generate a new SSH key, and run a git
> rebase…“
>
> “Just clone the dev branch, add those three grunt tasks, and recompile…”
>
> “Just use this software/platform/toolkit/methodology…”
>
> “Just” makes me feel like an idiot. “Just” presumes I come from a specific
> background, studied certain courses in university, am fluent in certain
> technologies, and have read all the right books, articles, and resources.
> “Just” is a dangerous word.

Like Brad, I often feel like an idiot; but I know I'm not alone, you're never
alone[^1].

The story goes that the Oracle of Delphi told Socrates that he was
the wisest man in Athens and, being the thinker that he was, he didn't think it
was possible for him to be the wisest.  Socrates went around to talk to all the
wisest people he could find to prove he wasn't the wisest. After talking to all
the smartest [Sophists][^2], he found that each of them thought they knew a
lot, but Socrates didn't think any of their answers were satisfactory.
Ultimately this led him to his famous Socratic Paradox: "The only true wisdom
is in knowing that you know nothing."

Most folks raised in western culture know the phrase "Sticks and Stones can
break your bones, but words can never hurt you", but we've also heard hurtful
words. [Conway's Law][3] is an addage that states that "Any organization that
designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a
copy of the organization's communication structure." It turns out that words
are very important.

[^1]: At least, you're never alone in the sense that I mean in that sentence,
  sometimes you're physically alone, I mean in the broader sense of "am I the
  only one who feels this way?"

[^2]: "Sophist" is an ancient greek word meaning "Teacher" - from "Sophos"
  meaning "Wise Man"
