> Software development is a social process, not a sum of individuals process.

Kent Beck, interview, The Agile Revolution podcast, 2/20/2020

The Oracle of Delphi told Socrates that he was the wisest
man in Athens and, being the thinker that he was, he didn't think that was
possible. So, he went around to talk to all the wisest people he could find to
prove the oracle wrong. He found that although the smartest [Sophists][^1]
thought they knew a lot, Socates thought they were as dumb as he was. Leading
him to the paradox: "The only true wisdom is in knowing that you know nothing."
Shakespear eventually paraphrased this as "The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man
knows himself to be a fool," and Batty from Ferngully summarized it to "Only fools are positive."

In 2014 there were a few people talking about how ["Just"][1] is [the most
dangerous word in software development][2], Brad Frost says:

> “Just” makes me feel like an idiot. “Just” presumes I come from a specific
> background, studied certain courses in university, am fluent in certain
> technologies, and have read all the right books, articles, and resources.
> “Just” is a dangerous word.


All of us feel like idiots sometimes, and maybe we are sometimes, we're only human.
It's not just the word "just," there are many small hostilities we face on a daily basis.
Most folks know the phrase "Sticks and Stones can break your bones, but words can never hurt you", but we've also heard hurtful words like this.

[Conway's Law][3] is an addage that states that "Any organization that designs
a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of
the organization's communication structure." With that in mind, do we really want to perpetuate
hostile communications? Is this really what's best for our users?

[The Recourse Center has 4 social rules][4] to "help create a friendly, intellectual environment" are:

> No well-actually’s (when you correct someone about something that’s not relevant to the conversation or tangential to what they’re trying to say)
> No feigned surprise (when you act surprised when someone doesn’t know something)
> No backseat driving (when you lob advice from across the room, or across the online chat, without really joining or engaging in a conversation)
> No subtle -isms (subtle expressions of racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia and other kinds of bias and prejudice)

All these rules are intended to make people feel welcome and free to focus on programming instead of playing power games.

> Most of our social rules really boil down to "don't be a jerk" or "don't be
> annoying." Of course, almost nobody sets out to be a jerk or annoying, so
> telling people not to be jerks isn't a very productive strategy. That's why
> our social rules are designed to curtail specific behavior we've found to be
> destructive to a supportive, productive, and fun learning environment.

"best practices" is an opinion & doesn't mean anything specific... https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/322777/143539
ask about better practices, effective practices, or promising practices instead - what's best in this context, not just best in general - best is too general
