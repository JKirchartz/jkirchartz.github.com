There's a 1948 American propaganda film called "Make Mine Freedom" that tells us some of the dangers of an "imported doubletalk" called "-Ism."
Since it was made during the Cold War it's McCarthey-esque ham-fistedness shows which 'ism' they were particularly concerned about without mentioning any one specifically.
It's often shared by conservatives as evidence that Obama (or any other "liberal") is a full-blown communist, the next Marx/Lennin/Mao, and they're just generally un-American.
Watching this short you'll see how hard they try not to say "capitalism," but in hindsight it seems Capitalism has turned out exactly like this evil nameless soul-crushing 'ism.'

"Ism will cure any ailment of the body politic," claims "Dr. Utopia," as he presents bottles of 'ISM' to a laborer, a farmer, a manufacturer, a politician, and a regular Joe.
Like snake-oil salesmen of yore, Dr Utopia over-sells his product, even going so far to claim it will improve the weather.
But before 'ism' can cure the various characters they must sign a contract stating "I hereby turn over to Ism, Incorporated, everything I have, including my freedom, and the freedom of my children, and my children's children, in return for which said Ism promises to take care of me forever."
Wouldn't it be nice to get the opportunity to sign onto the existing social contract before being forced into it?
These are vauge terms for a contract, but no more vague that the unsigned social contract we're born into &amp; taught about in schools.
Some Libertarians argue that this sort of contracting should be legal for individuals to do, because preventing indentured servitude and paying a living wage somehow prevents their theoretical "free market" from working.

Luckily our John Q Public shows us how freedom (nee capitalism) works: if you have an idea and can convince your friends (who in this instance, have never heard of a bank) to give you money, you can start a business and possibly become a major corporation.
This freedom is terrific, because Americans in seersucker suits are free to make more money than the next 6 stereotypical caricatures of foreign nationals from capitalistic countries combined!
In fact, America's free educational system that sends more white people to highschool and college than any other sterotypical caricature of a nationality.
John Q Public, playing the voice of reason, suggests that just a taste will show us the dangers of Ism, immediately plunging his peers into a totalitarian wet dream.

1. Employers chain their workers to their stations, Unions mark their workers (double-unluckily '1313'), and anti-strike laws prevent workers from participating in collective action.

Here in the future of capitalist America, you don't need chains when you can have [mandatory unpaid security checks][1] to waste employees time and [adult-diapers to prevent paid bathroom breaks][2], so employees don't waste your time.
States have prevented the danger of union membership by implementing [right-to-work laws][3] that have made membership optional.
Why spend your hard-earned money for union membership when you can get the benefits of the Union's collective bargaining and have a few extra bucks to spend?
If you take a Union job, in a state with [Davis-Bacon laws][4], and you're not a member of the union you get the 'prevailing wage' which the majority of union workers earn, and you still won't need to unionize.
However, without funding and members, Unions are dwindling and their collective bargaining power is going with it.
Impact this with [at-will employment][5] and you can lose (or quit) your job at any time for any or no reason without notice, unionizing, going on strike, or literally anything else could be a fireable offense.
Sure it may be illegal to be fired for some things like race, religion, and gender, but if they want you out it's easy enough to come up with any or no reason.

2. "The State is the Supreme Court, no more Private Property, no more you."

This brief segment firstly ignores that the Judiciary Branch is part of the trinity of vested powers in the United States.
As a function of this brand of -ism, private property and capitalist have been outlawed, preventing CEOs the freedom of exploiting their workers to receive obscene, or any, profits.
However, in "Communist" China CEOs are still very much involved in [State-Capitalism][6] and are well-paid for their efforts.

3. Farmers are now slaves that can no longer vote

Another brief and terrifying segment. Fortunately voting is a fundamental right in our democracy (since 1965), and we've has prevented chattel slavery through a civil war and reconstruction.
Without the vote, farmers can't obtain seed, for some unspecified reason.
But here in the future we've proven that [Agricultural Subsidies][7] are a more palatable method of controlling farm produce.
Farmers are paid to grow various crops and not others, but mostly they're paid to grow corn; providing us with an overabundance of cheap corn-based products such as feed, ethanol fuel additives and high fructose corn syrup.

4. Politicians and Nay-sayers are put in pens and replaced by yes-men.

Here's another chilling example of how much supposed American ideals have (or haven't) changed.
Protesters and Nay-sayers are often placed in [Free Speech Zones][8] far from the politicians who they wish to address.
Dissidents will be corralled and [kettled][9], far from those in positions of power who they're trying to reach..

<!-- In the 2016 election the only candidate who expresses concern about the flaws in capitalism is often ignored by the media, in favor of his opponents who believe capitalism is beyond reproach. -->


Our John Q Public gets the last word,

> When anybody breaches unity and tried to pit one of us against the other through class warfare, race hatred, or religious intolerance. You know that person seeks to rob us of our freedom and destroy our very lives.
> And we know what to do about it!

Apparently what you do about it is watch their cartoon, then find an un-American to chase out of town, because utopian ideas aren't welcome here; free speech be damned!

In hindsight history and this cartoon shows the dangers of and one -Ism given dominant power:  Due to inevitable corruption anybody but the powerful suffers.
