title: "Dead Internet Theory"

---


There's an online conspiracy theory that suggests that we don't actually
interact with other humans on the internet anymore, just robots automatically
generating content and responses, algorithmically curating individual humans
for data and separating us from our peers for marketing purposes. Believers of
this Theory say [the Internet died in 2016.][1]

Social Media was supposed to keep us together, but how often do you really see
your Facebook, or Twitter[^1], or Mastodon friends? Even if they live in the
same city as you? We're [not getting out much][2], and it's not easy to [make
friends][3], [especially as adults][4]
