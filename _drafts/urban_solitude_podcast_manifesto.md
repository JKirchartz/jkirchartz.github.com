Urban Solitude is about being alone in a crowded space.

The goal of the Urban Solitude podcast is to create engaging content in a
crowded space. To blend into the city and become part of the scenery while
broadcasting the modern experience. Will there be guests? Will they stick around
long enough to talk? Does it matter?
