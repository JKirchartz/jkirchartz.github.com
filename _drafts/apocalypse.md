The word "Apocalypse" comes from the Greek word apokalypsis which literally means "something uncovered" or "revealed." [^1]

[20% of Christians][1] and [50% of Muslims][2] believe that the eschaton[^2]
will occur in their lifetime. Christendom has been waiting two thousand years,
a portion of each generation believing the end will come within their
lifetimes. They've all been wrong, but that doesn't stop people from still
being wrong. I've personally survived 44 apocalypses[^3], and built an app to
help everyone else figure out ["How many apocalypses have I survived?"][6].

Unfortunately, the end is not nigh, not in a universal sense. The End has
already come and gone for many civilizations, and our period of relative
stability may come to an end some day; usually it happens on a much smaller scale - like [the aftermath of natural disasters][5]

A belief in the End of All Times isn't unique to Abrahamic religions,

> “We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in our art, the art of words.”

> ― Ursula K. Le Guin

Both World Wars were Apocalypses - some of the battlefields are still a
no-man's land a century later -- the ground poisoned by chemical warfare,
humanity doesn't seem to have learned much from the lessons revealed from any
of these apocalypses.

[^3]: That's not included the hundreds of earlier prophecies (some fulfilled) of societal collpse.
[^2]: "divinely ordained climax of history," coined by Protestant theologian Charles Harold Dodd in 1935 (1884-1973) from Greek eskhaton, neuter of eskhatos "last, furthest, uttermost" according to [etymonline][4]
[^1]: Maybe we'll get into apocryphic apocalypses, i.e. `apocrypha` from the Greek apokryphos "hidden; obscure, hard to understand,"
