the internet breeds extremism. It's the perfect place for it. You sit safely in 
your home, secreted away from prying eyes, alone with every other person 
secreted away and trawling the internet. There's nobody to stop you from 
learning about what you want to knowa, except for your own limitations (or some 
DMCA takedown notice that only slows you down)

Internet algorithms are bubbling you, learning what you like, think, agree with,
and then repeating the same sort of content to you over and over; no opposing 
views, no Real Facts(tm), just the things YOU want to see.
