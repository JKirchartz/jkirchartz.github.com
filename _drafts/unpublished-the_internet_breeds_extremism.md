The internet breeds extremism. It's the perfect place for it. You sit safely in
your home, away from prying eyes, alone with every other person
secreted away and trawling the internet. There's nobody to stop you from
learning about what you want to know, except for your own limitations (or some
DMCA takedown notice that only slows you down)

Internet algorithms are bubbling you, learning what you like, think, agree with,
and then repeating the same sort of content to you over and over; no opposing
views, no Real Facts(tm), just the things YOU want to see.

Twitter has pitchforks and torches prepared for your convenience.
