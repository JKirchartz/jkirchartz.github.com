[Marcel Duchamp][1] is perhaps the most famous member of the [Dada][2] art movement,
his first ["readymade"][3] objet d'art was _Fountain_, a urinal signed "R. Mutt."
You might be wondering how, exactly, is signing a urinal art?  Well, as Andy
Warhol said, well after that happened, "Art is what you can get away with."
Duchamp's readymades put mundane objects before the eyes of art critics for
serious consideration as art, throwing aesthetic back in their faces.

Well, What's this have to do with bots? I'll tell ya: They're not as hard to
make as you think. With SaaS and mashup tools online, you don't even need to
know how to code!


# Web-based Services
[tweetjukebox.com][4] Schedule lists of pre-conceived tweets, this site imports CSV files (output from
Excel or Google Spreadsheets, but simple enough to write in Notepad or TextEdit)
and will tweet them on a set schedule. They also have sets of ready-made tweets
you can incorporate.

[roundteam.co][5]
Twitter automation powertool

[ifttt.com][6]
Services to other Services

[dlvr.it][7] / [twibble.io][8]
RSS feed to twitter

[cheapbotsdonequick.com][9] is a tool to use generative grammar to make new and
interesting tweets, this is the only tool on this list that involves coding.
CBDQ uses Tracery, a javascript library that takes marked up strings inside of a
JSON object to output new stories from smaller chunks of text.


[Google Sheets Twitterbot][10] -- use Google Sheets to automate a twitter account [Allison Parrish has a nice writeup on how to make this work](http://air.decontextualize.com/twitterbot/)

# Code Libraries
[github.com/huginn/huginn][11] build agents that perform automated tasks for you online -- like ifttt on steroids.

[hubot.github.com/][12] Github's very own bot platform, connect it to IRC, Twitter, Slack, Wherever, and with all the plugins and extensibility you can easily make him your own.

# Other Bots
[motion.ai][13]
This is a neat tool that lets you visually connect chunks of functionality into
a full-fledged bot without writing a line of code, there's no built-in twitter
functionality, but email, messanger, slack, and more are possible.


Inspired by all these tools, I've been playing with building my own - but that's a story for another time -- buy me a [kofi](http://ko-fi.com/Q5Q79ZEI) or [convince me to get a patreon](mailto:me@jkirchartz.com?subject=Get%20A%20Patreon%2C%20fool&body=I%20want%20to%20patronize%20you%20on%20patreon%20so%20I%20can%20make%20bots%20too%21)
