[Marcel Duchamp][1] is perhaps the most famous member of the [Dada][2] art movement,
his first ["readymade"][3] objet d'art was _Fountain_, a urinal signed "R. Mutt."
You might be wondering how, exactly, is signing a urinal art?  Well, as Andy
Warhol said, well after that happened, "Art is what you can get away with."
Duchamp's readymades put mundane objects before the eyes of art critics for
serious consideration as art, throwing aesthetic back in their faces.

Well, What's this have to do with bots? I'll tell ya: They're not as hard to
make as you think. With SaaS and mashup tools online, you don't even need to
know how to code.
