Every time morbid curiosity tempts me to look behind the Medium Paywall a new
horror awaits. The last time I looked it was an AI-generated article
advertising an AI-generated book about how you can use AI to make money writing
books and articles, signed by a business name. Todays eyeroll comes from ["I
Interviewed 20+ Engineers. Here's Why Most Can't Code." by The Latency
Gambler](https://medium.com/@kanishks772/i-interviewed-20-engineers-heres-why-most-can-t-code-b647d23f8c89)
who has interviewed 23 people for an SDE-2[^1] position over the past year.

This seems to be a change of pace, because before he'd interviewed from Intern
all the way to SDE-1*

```
Problem 1 (Intern/SDE-1):
"Design a rate limiter that allows 100 requests per user per hour"
```
This is a great question for an intern in Comp-Sci, it's probably something they just learned in college

```
Problem 2 (SDE-2):
"Implement a cache with TTL that can handle 10k ops/sec"
```

> My go-to problems aren’t LeetCode hard. They’re practical scenarios we face
> daily... These aren’t algorithm puzzles. They’re real-world engineering
> problems that require basic problem-solving skills."
but, do you really need to re-build 

[^1]: Amazon-speak (if you wanted to know what his "B2B SaaS Company" might be) for Software Development Engineer with 2-5 years of experience
[^2]: Intern and SDE-1 have the same expectations judging by the questions posed - e.g. a comp-sci degree
