I've been trying to spend more and more time offline, but I find that when most
of the stuff you read comes in a digital format it's hard to keep up when
you're not connected. That's where this technique really helps. For this you
will need a couple of browser plugins which are both available for Chrome &amp;
Firefox: [one-tab][1] and [epub.press][2].

The idea is simple

1. use One-Tab to store a set of tabs (it enables you to organize them into lists and even share them online)
2. restore a curated One-Tab list to it's own browser window (each link in its own tab)
3. Compile them into an epub
4. Switch my phone to airplane mode and actually read.
