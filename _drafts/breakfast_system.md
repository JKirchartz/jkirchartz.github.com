Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, no matter what time of day you eat it.
As a standard American I quite enjoy the standard American breakfast of eggs, bacon, and toast.
Occasionally I enjoy hashbrowns too, but hashbrowning is outside the scope of this article; If you do want hashbrowns, use the frozen kind and start cooking them after preheating the oven.

Without further ado, I present my proven Breakfast For Two System.

## Items required:
* 5 eggs (2 for each person, plus one more):egg:
* Approximately 3 Tablespoons of Milk, or Water (if medically necessary)
* Approximately 3 Tablespoons of Unsalted Butter
* 8 strips of bacon (4 for each person):pig:
* 4 slices of bread (2 for each person):bread:
* One large pinch of salt
* One or Two grinds of a pepper mill
* Cheese or anything else you'd like to add to your eggs (optional)
* Paper Towels
* Aluminum Foil (optional, but improves cleanup)
* Baking sheet, the type with a rim around the edges; this works best with one a little smaller than your aluminum foil
* 12-inch Skillet
* Rubber or Silicon spatula
* Griddle, or square pan, anything that fits 4 slices of bread
* 2 oven-safe plates (preferably warmed, by sitting atop or in the oven or submerged in hot water)


## Directions:

1. Preheating oven to 400°

2. Whisk eggs with milk, pinch(es) of salt, and grind(s) of pepper. Allowing this to rest lets the salt to start untangling the proteins in the eggs and increases deliciousness and moisture after cooking retangles said proteins. It goes against the conventional wisdom, but [Alton Brown proved it](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/04/does-pre-salting-eggs-make-them-tough.html)

3. Put foil on baking sheet so that the foil covers all 4 sides.

4. Apply bacon liberally to baking sheet

5. Put bread on griddle (square pan holds 4 slices if placed in a swastika-like pattern)

6. The oven should be preheated around 350° by now, so you can put in the bacon & set a timer for 12 minutes

7. Prepare paper towels to drain bacon on (if half-sized sheets, 3 sheets folded in half for the bottom, and another prepared similarly for the top)

8. Put a little over 1 tbsp of butter in Skillet

9. Put the skillet on High heat & the griddle around medium (heat depends on the burners & pans etc. Good tools are just as important as knowing your tools)

10. As soon as the melted butter begins to bubble pour eggs directly in the center of the pan, and stir slowly

11. The bacon should be about done now, so pull the bacon and put it on the paper towels while stirring the eggs slowly

13. Flip bread to the untoasted side, while slowly stirring the eggs

12. Large soft lumps should be forming in the eggs, so turn the skillet to low heat, and stop stirring so much as flipping the eggs about and shimmying the pan to allow liquid eggs under the cooked bits

13. Add cheese or other optional goodies to the eggs

14. Bread should be done, so pull it off the heat and begin applying the rest of the butter.

15. After the first 2 slices of bread are buttered it should be time to pull the eggs from the heat and put on their respective plates

16. Apply bread and bacon to the plates and serve.
