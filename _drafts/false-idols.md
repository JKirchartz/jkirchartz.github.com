My speciality (if I have one as a web developer) is turning real things into
digital things ... but the magic idea of digital things that makes real things
based off digital pseudo-ideas of real things based on a statistically-probably
melange of real things as described by humans, and all that just works reliably
with nature is skipping the scientific method of the whole method, there's a
physicality to experiments in the real world that Pure Reason cannot
comprehend.
