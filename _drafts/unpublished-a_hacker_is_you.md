The news makes it seem like [hackers][2] are always up to no good, breaking into
computer networks and stealing data, generally causing chaos; The news likes to
sensationalize things. Some might call them "Black-hat" hacks (like the
Stetsons worn by villains in cowboy movies) but [the correct term is Cracker][1], there's also gray hat &amp; white
hat hackers, and [redhat](http://www.redhat.com/) hackers too.  In fact, if
you've ever solved a problem, a hacker is you!
