title: Radio Shack

I worked at Radio Shack at a strip mall[^1] in Bethel Park from 2004, until
right before I graduated college in 2006. My first shift was 11 Hours at the
start of the Holiday Season, I was such a fresh employee I had to change into
their Polo shirt in the back room.

Radio Shack lost its way and didn't join the Makers Movement until it was too
late - and then only to exploit it ... they should've been setting up a table
on wednesday nights and teaching classes or something

They used to brag that their CEO worked their way up from the Sales floor --
but all they ever harped on was selling subscriptions -- VOIP, Satellite Radio,
Cell Phone Plans ... at one time Radio Shack was there to sell radio parts to
people who wanted to build radios
