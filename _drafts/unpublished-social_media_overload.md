You won't want to miss this! Don't miss a thing! Keep in touch with ALL your
friends! Never miss an update! Subscribe! Why!? Why do we need to suck in so much
information? Most of it is useless irrelevant crap (Trust me, I'm a "Social
Media Expert") It's not exactly all "Making a massive BM, &#35;lol &#35;omg
&#35;wtf &#35;pooptweeting &#35;hashtag", but pretty close. Everybody's vying
for your time and attention, everybody has something to sell, everybody has
something clever to say, or not-so-clever as the case may be. Why should you
worry about it?

## Don't
"What!? Are you crazy!?" I hear you say, and my only reply can be "YES!  Just
give up!" Media is a firehose, millions of articles and trillions of posts are
made every day all over the world.  Here's my very simple technique to end
social media fatigue: don't try to see everything. Just take the occasional sip
&mdash; You can't do everything all at once. No matter how good you think you
are at multitasking, you're wrong.


## So how do I maintain my presence?
It's easy to stay up to date &mdash; Subscribe to RSS feeds and newsletters,
join relevant facebook groups, make friends who know you personally and will
send you things you might want to see. Signup for an account on Hootsuite,
Buffer, or Tumblr and queue posts to be shared in the future. Don't waste your
time being physically present at every moment.
