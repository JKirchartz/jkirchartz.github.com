Humans are story-telling animals. We love a good story, we tell stories about
ourselves and the world around us &ndash; and sometimes use allegory and
imagination to tell stories about worlds could be, or we use intuition and
imagination to fill in gaps in our knowledge. Our cultural perception is based
on our experiences as much as it is about these stories. Our stories shape what
is possible in the world around us as much as the world shapes our stories.

The most groundbreaking innovation in culture was the invention of writing. For
around 6000 years we've had written records of these stories - some as
histories, others as dramatizations - often transcribed from oral traditions or
other languages. All of history is a game of telephone we play with our
ancestors, but now that it's written down it can be consumed, analyzed, and
compared.
