You work hard brainstorming your company values, hours of meetings, days of
discussion, and finally you come up with a handful of things that define who
you are as a corporate person. A list of words or concepts, but like really
good, deep, and meaningful ones, man! It's one thing to pay lip service to
values, point at a sign on the wall, and say "This is what We are!" Just one
teeny tiny little problem: it's something else entirely to really live these
values.

You can say you value "Togetherness" and "Teamwork" but what do you mean?
You're together in the same room, or under the same roof, or at least have the
same person signing all your checks. You work together to acheive a common
goal, but that's the nature of having a job. But what's the use of being "together"
on a "team" if you don't communicate? Communication isn't just calling a meeting
to recite sales numbers and give the latest roadmap update, it's a two-way
street where every member of the team is offered a chance to participate, and
individual contributions recognized.

You value "Innovation," you better. Nobody wants a carbon copy, you need to bring
your own special mojo to the table. If you haven't found what makes you special
At least innovate with your process, perfect the method behind making your core
product, file down the sharp edges and reduce internal friction. Ambition isn't
so much stress as it is trying harder and experiencing individual growth. If
you're doing the same exact thing you did two years ago and getting the similar
results, you're not growing and certainly not innovating.

Try as you might to dictate your culture though, it's probably not going to
work. Your company's culture is a conglomerate of each employee's individual
talents and personalities. You can try to hire based on 'fit' or some semblance
of who you are and who your employees should be - but when cultural fit is a
large portion of your hiring criteria you're only going to get one type of employee.
