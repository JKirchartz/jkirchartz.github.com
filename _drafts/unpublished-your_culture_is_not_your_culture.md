You work hard brainstorming your company values, hours of meetings, days of
discussion, and finally you come up with a handful of things that define who
you are (as a corporate person.) But are these values really the same thing that
drives your company's growth, allowing it to flourish and bloom?

It's one thing to pay lip service to values, point at a sign on the wall, and
say "This is what We are!" It's quite another to live these values and actually
work together. You can say "We Work Together" and not actually collaborate,
togetherness is already facilitated by your office space.

communication is too important to ignore.


>> It has a ‘big vision’, and people forgot about the details, and forgot about admitting when they went wrong.
