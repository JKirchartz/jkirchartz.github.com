You're expanding - finally a second floor or multiple offices or your second round of hiring - it's the big show now.
You've got to project your vision and image on a whole new group of employees.
You work hard brainstorming your company values, hours of meetings, days of discussion, and finally you get a handful of things that define who You are as a Corporate Person.
A list of words or concepts, about how fun and unique and valuable your business is, but like really good and meaningful ones, man!
It's easy to pay lip service to these values, point at a sign on the wall, and say "This is what We are!" but do those values actually lead to success?

You might say you value "Togetherness" or "Teamwork" but what do you mean?
You're together in the same room, or under the same roof, or at least have the
same person signing all your checks. You work together to acheive a common
goal, but that's the nature of the job. But are you acting like a team? What's the use of working "together"
if you don't communicate? Communication isn't just calling a meeting
to recite sales numbers and give the latest roadmap update, it's a two-way
street where every member of the team is offered a chance to participate, and
individual contributions recognized. Nobody should be unable or afraid to question or dissent.

You may choose to value "Working Smart" or "Innovation," good.
Nobody wants a carbon copy, You need to bring your own special mojo to the table.
But how are you innovating?
If you haven't found what makes You special at least improve your processes, hone your marketing and sales chops, perfect the method behind making your core product, file down the sharp edges and reduce internal friction.
Ambition isn't so much stress as it is trying harder and experiencing individual growth.
When a team grows together, it creates an indelable bond that no on-boarding procedure can replicate.
If you're doing the same exact thing you did two years ago and getting the similar results, you're not growing and certainly not innovating.

Try as you might to dictate your culture, it's probably not going to work.
Your company's culture is a conglomerate of each employee's individual talents and personalities.
You can try to hire based on 'fit' or some semblance of who you are and who your employees should be - but when cultural fit is a large portion of your hiring criteria you're only going to get one type of employee.

> It has a ‘big vision’, and people forgot about the details, and forgot about admitting when they went wrong.
