You work hard brainstorming your company values, hours of meetings, days of
discussion, and finally you come up with a handful of things that define who
you are (as a corporate person.) A list of words or concepts, but like really
good, and deep, and meaningful ones, man! It's one thing to pay lip service to
values, point at a sign on the wall, and say "This is what We are!" It's quite
another to live these values.

You can say you value "Togetherness" and "Teamwork" but what do you mean?
You're together in the same room, or under the same roof, or at least have the
same person signing all your checks. You work together as a team to acheive a
common goal, that's the nature of having a job. But what's the use of being
"together" on a "team" if there's deficient communication? Communication isn't
just calling a meeting to recite sales numbers, or the latest roadmap update,
it's a two-way street where every member of the team is offered a chance to
participate.

"Innovation," you better innovate - nobody wants a carbon copy, you need to bring
your own special mojo to the table. At least innovate with your process, perfect
the method behind making your core product, file down the sharp edges and reduce
internal friction. Ambition isn't stress, it's trying harder and experiencing individual
growth.

>> It has a ‘big vision’, and people forgot about the details, and forgot about admitting when they went wrong.

>> Do the have a real mission and culture or just hedonism and homogeneity? Do
>> they invest in an individual's growth, or just increase productivity?
