Meetings need itineraries &amp; start/end times, and to stick to them - in a
shared doc everybody can put a blurb/links to their issues to discuss during the meeting.
A meeting can go 5 minutes over, but shouldn't go any further, schedule 
additional meetings if more discussion is required.


Stress needs a post-mortum - If there's an error in the workflow that causes 
people to step on eachother's toes or causes any other stress for the team
it needs to be discussed to avoid repeating the same problem in the future. 
Learn from your mistakes so you don't relive them.

Nothing is set in stone, until it needs to be set in stone. Specs and workflows 
are rarely perfect their first time out, they need to me improved upon 
iteratively. After something is perfected then it can be made the law of the 
land.
