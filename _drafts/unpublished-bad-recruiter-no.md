Seems these days that the only way to get a job is through a recruiter - a 3rd 
party human resources team. These companies all have basically the same M.O. 
make money by filling positions for companies who don't wanna do their own HR.
It's a lucrative business, sometimes they can get paid more than your potential 
salary for your placement.


Here's some annoying shit recruiters need to stop doing:

1. not sending job descriptions
2. sending job descriptions completely unrelated to your resume
3. Calling you, going to voicemail, then calling you back (possibly without 
   leaving a message)
