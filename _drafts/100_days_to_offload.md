A friend mentioned [100 days to Offload][1] to me, and it got me thinking, I
sure do have a lot of drafts here on by blog, and not a lot of content.  I get
myself stuck in this rut where I write something, then don't really finish it
&mdash; editing is hard &mdash; and wanting to be "right" and fact-checking
everything is difficult, too. But being mistaken is nothing to be ashamed of,
these posts are editable, the world moves on, and it's not like I'm a celebrity
blogger by any stretch of the imagination, so I should just get on with it!

Ultimately, this site contains my writings, resume, and portfolio - so there is
a degree of professionalism I strive for; but not everything I write needs to
be focused entirely on writing and maintaining code, culture is important too.

In the next 12 months I strive to create, finish, and/or publish 100 articles,
and maybe build a new habit where I get things out of my head and into the
world.

As suggested in the inspiration of this, I leave you with this final statement:
