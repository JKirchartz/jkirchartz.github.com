Imagine a friend shows you a photo of a book online &mdash; well, you presume
it's a book, it could be a magazine, an encyclopedia, or even a journal, it's
hard to tell from a picture &mdash; there's at least a lovely photograph and
what could be a title, it's hard to make out. Of course you've seen books and
magazines, perhaps you're an avid reader, but you've never seen anything
exactly like this. Your friend wants to know how long it would take to read,
Minutes? Hours? Days? Weeks? Admittedly it's not much to go on, so you decide
to ask your friend some clarifying questions. How many pages? Is it a greeting
card, a pop-up book, a comic book, a novel? Does it have large print? What's
it about? Who would read something like this? Your friend's not certain, they
haven't read it, but they have heard that it's not very long perhaps 20 pages
and plenty of pictures. Sounds like a comic book, maybe even a childrens book.
So, How long would it take to read it? You estimate a minute per page, but
aren't really sure so you bump it up bit. You tell your friend it'll take about
30 minutes.

This is what it's like estimating time for a poorly planned project. You have a
goal in mind, but not enough information to know for certain how long it will
take.
