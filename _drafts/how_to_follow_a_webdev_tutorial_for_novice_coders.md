title: How to follow a Web-Dev Tutorial for novice coders

Tutorials show you what to do - they don't tend to explain why
I think it's from the arrogance of knowledge - the author KNOWS it, so everybody reading it should too - which is hardly the case
the way I see it - following tutorials word-for-word gets you what's described in the tutorial - understanding the underlying stuff is the hard part, so here I'll try to explain the basics of web-dev in a novice-friendly way.

Everything is boxes inside of boxes

in css . denotes a class - # an id - and a plain word is a tag - so div.class#id = <div class="class" id="id"> </div>

CSS is cascading style sheet â€” so everything at the bottom of the file overrides things above it in the file

an ID should be a unique selector - so there should only be one home ID on the whole page

a class can be anything - so you can have as many .blue classes as you want
and tags are the structure of your page - like an outline where <h1> - <h3> etc are headings and the <p> paragraphs between them
