Magic? What's in a word; according to every dictionary I've ever held there are
usually 2, but sometimes maybe a dozen definitions &mdash; the dictionary isn't
there to set these definitions, mind you, but to record the different ways that
words are used. So Magic may be Esoteric & Occult works, or tricks like sleight
of hand, or a sense of mystery and wonder.

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
> ~ Arthur C. Clarke (Author, Futurist)


> We've arranged a society on science and technology in which nobody
> understands anything about science and technology, and this combustible
> mixture of ignorance and power sooner or later is going to blow up in our
> faces.
> ~ Carl Sagan (Astronomer, Science Communicator)


> "Magic has informed robotics, technology, science, art. All these fields have
> been moved forward by the art of magic..."
> "People don't understand magic as well as they do music or other forms of
> theatre," he said. "You have to kind of remind them of the artistry of it and
> the hard work that goes behind it."
> ~ David Copperfield (Illusionist)

> There is some confusion as to what magic actually is. I think this can be
> cleared up if you just look at the very earliest descriptions of magic. Magic
> in its earliest form is often referred to as “the art”. I believe this is
> completely literal. I believe that magic is art and that art, whether it be
> writing, music, sculpture, or any other form is literally magic.
> ~ Alan Moore (Author, Occultist)
