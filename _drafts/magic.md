Magic? What's in a word; according to every dictionary I've ever held there are
usually 2, but sometimes maybe a dozen definitions &mdash; the dictionary isn't
there to set these definitions, mind you, but to record the different ways that
words are used. So Magic may be Esoteric & Occult works, or tricks like sleight
of hand, or a sense of mystery and wonder.

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
> ~ Arthur C. Clarke (Author, Futurist)

> We've arranged a society on science and technology in which nobody
> understands anything about science and technology, and this combustible
> mixture of ignorance and power sooner or later is going to blow up in our
> faces.
> ~ Carl Sagan (Astronomer, Science Communicator)

> "Magic has informed robotics, technology, science, art. All these fields have
> been moved forward by the art of magic..."
> "People don't understand magic as well as they do music or other forms of
> theatre," he said. "You have to kind of remind them of the artistry of it and
> the hard work that goes behind it."
> ~ David Copperfield (Illusionist)

> There is some confusion as to what magic actually is. I think this can be
> cleared up if you just look at the very earliest descriptions of magic. Magic
> in its earliest form is often referred to as “the art”. I believe this is
> completely literal. I believe that magic is art and that art, whether it be
> writing, music, sculpture, or any other form is literally magic.
> ~ Alan Moore (Author, Occultist)

Quotes like these led me to [*Defining Magic: A Reader*][1], where we can
survey Centuries of thought on what "Magic" is. [Plato][^1], for example, cuts
closest to the root with the word `μαγεία`(mageia), the wisdom taught to the
mysteryious and foreign Persian Kings and Princes, where "Magic" is defined as
the correct "worship of the god," this wisdom was taught to the mysteryious and foreign
Persian Kings and Princes, [Madam Blavatsky][^2] later echoes this sentimenti saying "Magic consists
of, and is acquired by the worship of the gods."

Alan Moore isn't present in this reader, but he seems to be more of a
practitioner than a historian from what I've seen of his latest book [*The
Moon and Serpent Bumper Book of Magic*][2], but popular conceptions of history
always play a little fast and loose to provide a more compelling narrative. At
bottom, humans are storytellers, and this is the basis of our conceptions of
reality and magic.

*Defining Magic* presents a triangular scale between Science, Religion, and
Magic - where the tangible and intangible can mix in natural ways -
