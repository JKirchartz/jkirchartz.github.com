1) You'll learn a lot.

You'll have to, because you won't be taught much of anything unless you demand it.


2) Building a new team. / Always Hiring.

What happened to the old team? How can you always be hiring without always
expanding? Where did the people all go? Chances are high turnover is because
the folks who left knew something you didn't.


3) We're family/friends!

Nobody who has told me this during the hiring process has ever helped me move,
given me a ride to the airport, or loaned me $20 - let alone spray bactine on
my scraped knee and put a bandaid on it. Save the friends/family talk for at
home, in the office it's called nepotism, and during the hiring process it's
just creepy.


4) We Have Fun!

Your managers have fun. You, the unseen, pick up the slack.
