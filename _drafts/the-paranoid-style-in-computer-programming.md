title: The Paranoid Style in Computer Programming
---


I know what I'm doing, in a different language, on a different stack, in a different configutation, with a different tool.
But I have come here with assumptions; all my experiences of the world; and I don't know if I'm doing something real or imaginary until I run it past the compiler.
(Blessed is He whose build works on the first try)
