I'm in a unique position where I grew up with the internet, in my formative
years I was learning HTML and making Flash animations. I got into Actionscript
to make my animations better, and eventually interactive. I wasn't doing
ground-breaking work[^1], but I was having fun and learning a lot.

Browser wars were had, the Dot-Com bubble burst, and Browsers began following
standards - at first barely, then better and better[^2]. During this time, how the
world interacted with the internet changed drastically, from dial-in services
almost exclusively in front of large immobile machines, to always-connected
mobile device dominance and "blazing fast streaming."

Home computers and servers and T1 shared hosting made way for megacorporate
data clouds, The Internet evolved from niche microcultures passed by
word-of-mouth or at baud rate, and into global cultural dominance dangling like
a carrot at the end of a search query

It is the dream of many a computer programmer to give it all up and live a
bucolic live herding sheep or somesuch. And here they may find that the world
isn't entirely connected. There's a time to sow your wild oats, and there's a
time to reap them; similarly there's a time to follow trends and go with the
flow, and a time to say "enough is enough."

I'm not ready to start herding sheep, but I am tired of [shaving yaks][1], and
I don't want to solve any more problems that don't need solved.

I'm turning into a simple bucolic hacker, chopping wood and tending the fire.
