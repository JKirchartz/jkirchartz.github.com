This past week I participated in [Steel City Codefest][1], I've never done a hackathon before and wasn't sure at all what to expect.
This was truly a learning experience, and not just for all those participating, this year was the first time Steel City Codefest was a week-long event.

There were 6 challenges for 6 non-profits in the area.
[Allegheny Children's Initiative][2] needed an app for families to better collect behavioral data.
[Children's Museum of Pittsburgh][3] needed a tool to help guide and schedule their visitors through their often chaotic children's exhibits.
[Homewood Children's Village][4] was looking for something to help develop indiviualized plans for students' success, and improve communication between mentors, teachers, and advisors.
[involveMINT][5] wanted to create an app to incentivize volunteering.
[The Allegheny County Department of Human Services][6] needed a desktop tool to sanitize and categorize address data.
And [The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership (PDP) & City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works (DPW)][7] wanted to optimize the partnership between PDP's Clean Team and DPW's trash collectors.


There were a few familiar faces from the industry or around town, but a lot of people to meet, too.
The sponsors had their swag booths, and there were delicious snacks. Each organization presented their projects. Then we formed teams, a process of talking to people about their skills and which challenges they were considering.
I was thinking about The Alleghenny County DHS's project, since it was similar to my work at Google, but all the teams I talked to were talking about Allegheny Children's Initiative, Homewood Children's Village, and PDP &amp; DPW's challenges.

This is where I met [Jacob][8], [Roulan][9], and [Joni][10]; motion graphics, grad student/visualisation, and a dev/consultant, respectively.
We discussed our skills and thoughts on the project until the kick-off wound down to stacking chairs, we hailed an Uber and headed to The Hardware Store, and began planning.

Jon was interested in using [Meteor][11] with [React][12], and since I had just installed Meteor a week earlier, and was planning on playing with React, I followed his lead.
It was challenging getting over the initial hump with this stack, it was very flexible and just went through a major release, so there wasn't much new information available.
Roulan &amp; Jacob had some serious chops, creating map designs, icons, and videos nearly on the fly, while Roulan was doing course-work.
