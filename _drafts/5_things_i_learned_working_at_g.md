In remeberance of my time of working at Google, and since it's peak listicle season, here are

#5 things I learned working at Google.

#\#5 I did not work for Google
Since I was a contractor, I was not a Google employee, I did not work for
Google. I worked for some random staffing agency, so I cannot legally claim to
have worked for Google even though they paid me (by proxy) and benefited from my work.

#\#4 The Caste System is awkward
There's FTEs, Interns, then there's TVCs (Temps, Vendors, Contractors) - each gets a different colored badge.
FTEs get to drink beers, ride scooters, invite guests, go to off-site events, special talks, and travel.
TVCs get none of that, for legal reason, if there's not enough FTEs interested in a big talk then TVCs are invited to fill seats.
At every single event that the entire office *was* invited to another TVC would ask if we were allowed to be there.
We were never expelled, but it was always awkward.

#\#4 There are only 6 colors
Blue, Red, Yellow, Green, Black, White -- if you see a color that's not one of these, chances are it's not in Google.
Any lableling system there was limited to this group of colors, which makes sense, because it's their brand.

#\#3 All meetings need an Agenda
Creating an agenda for a meeting, where anybody could add any topic to be discussed at the meeting, helps keep things on track.
This agenda can even be edited during the meeting if something that warrants further discussion comes up.
It's great for avoiding Story-Time-style meetings where somebody has a captive audience for an hour.
An agenda keeps meetings from being a waste of time.
If you want to waste time schedule a "Sync Up" with a friend on your team, or at least in your department, and enjoy.

#\#2 Google has no Magic Mojo
Google is pretty much like every other company on the planet;
They don't have anything special to prevent problems with clients, communication, workflow, or staffing.
There's no secret to hiring their contractors, they had me do FizzBuzz.
They have all the resources they could ever want,
they can afford to send wave after wave of workers to dash themselves upon the rocks until the product works well enough for public consumption.


#\#1 It's just business
As a contractor, I had a pretty good idea of when a year contract would expire, but I didn't know if it'd be renewed or not.
I was mistaken in-so-much as my "year" contract only lasted 11 months.
Word on the street is that certain ammenities must be provided after you've worked somewhere for a year, but I haven't figured out what those may be.
During my last 2 weeks the word was funding for the next year wasn't determined yet and my contract would not be renewed, unfortunately I would no longer be working at (but specifically not *for*) Google.
About a week after my contract ended another staffing firm contacted me for the same position, this time paying half what I was making before.
I'm sure training somebody new to do the job is more cost-effective than keeping on somebody from last year;
At least I hope that's their logic, because I didn't get definitive reasons for why the contract wasn't renewed or extended.
