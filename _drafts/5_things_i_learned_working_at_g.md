title: 5 Things I Learned Working at (but specifically not for) Google

In honor of my time of working at (and apparently not *for*) Google, and since it's peak listicle season.

#Here are 5 things I learned working at (but legally not *for*) Google.

#\#5 There are only 6 colors
Blue, Red, Yellow, Green, Black, White -- if you see a color that's not one of
these, chances are it's not at Google.
Any lableling system there was limited to this group of colors, which makes sense, because it's their brand.
The brand is strong. Like, scary strong.


#\#4 The Caste System is awkward
There's FTEs (full time employees), Interns, then there's TVCs (Temps, Vendors,
Contractors) - each gets a different colored badge. FTEs get to drink beers,
ride scooters, invite guests, and go to off-site events, even travel. TVCs
get none of that. Interns are in the middle, learning new things and
working on projects, they may or may not get to contribute to a team, but
they'll definitely learn a lot. All are expected to pick up skills on the go,
but only employees and interns are *given* opportunities for self-improvement,
they get first dibs on presentations etc, if there's not enough interest then
TVCs are invited to fill seats. At every single event that the entire office
*was* invited to, another TVC would ask if we were allowed to be there, my only
response: "Let's see if they kick us out." -- and we never were -- although
there was always the awkward feeling like we were about to be...

If you are a Temp, Vendor, or Contractor you cannot claim to be an employee of Google by saying you work "at" Google, even if you work in Google's offices doing the same job as every other member of a team of FTEs.
I guess "at" is too legally ambiguous...

#\#3 Nobody knows anything until it's too late
Think your teammates or superiors know what they want or what they're talking about?
Maybe. Nobody knows anything; no matter how many meetings or how good you
are at communicating, knowledge is impossible. It's all one giant game of
telephone, starting with the clients. Since you can't write good tests without
good test data, you can try sampling production data, but even then you'll never
know if it's get good test data until something is live in production, at which
point it's too late and you have to rush to fix the issues nobody could've foreseen.

#\#2 All meetings need an Agenda
Googlers are diligent at creating an agenda for a meeting, where anybody could
add any topic relevant to the meeting, and discuss actual relevant work - this
is great for avoiding Story-Time-style meetings where somebody has a captive
audience to bore to death (which is more likely than you'd realize.) Meetings
are generally a waste of time, but sometimes it's deliberate, need a break?
Schedule a "Sync Up" with a friend on your team, or at least in your department, and enjoy one of Google's arcade, console, or tabletop games.

#\#1 Google has no Magic Mojo
Google is pretty much like every other company on the planet; They don't have any
magic mojo to prevent problems with clients, communication, workflow, or
staffing. There's no secret to hiring (they made me do FizzBuzz.) They just have
all the resources they could ever want, and they send wave after wave of workers
to dash themselves upon the rocks until the product works well enough for public
consumption. Their only real power is cold hard cash, enough that they
can do anything they could possible conceive and let failure roll off their backs.


#\#BONUS: Loyalty may be business liability?
As a contractor, I had a pretty good idea of when a year contract would expire, but I didn't know if it'd be renewed or not.
I was mistaken, my "year" contract only lasted 11 months.
Word on the street is that certain ammenities must be provided after you've worked somewhere for a year, but I haven't found much details about what those may be.
During my last 2 weeks the word was funding for the next year wasn't determined yet and my contract would not be renewed, unfortunately I would no longer be working at Google (but specifically *for* a contracting firm)

Even less fortunately, 10 days after my contract ended I received an email from another contracting firm for the same exact position on the same exact team.
At the time of writing I have not been contacted by my original firm to renew the contract, and if I did renew, it would probably be only for the money&hellip;
