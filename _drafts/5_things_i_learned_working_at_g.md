5. All meetings need an Agenda
G are quite good at creating an agenda for a meeting, where anybody could 
add any topic relevant to the meeting, and discuss actual relevant work - this 
is great for avoiding "Story-time with Fearless Leader"-style meetings where 
somebody has a captive audience to bore to death.

4. The caste system sucks
There's FTEs (full time employees), Interns, then there's TVCs (Temps, Vendors, 
Contractors) - each gets a different colored badge, and treated equivalent to 
their caste. FTEs get to drink beers, ride scooters, invite guests, and go to 
off-site events; even paid travel. TVCs get none of that. I don't know what 
interns do, I was only a TVC.

1. G has no Magic Mojo
G is exactly like every other company on the planet; They don't have any 
magic mojo to prevent problems with clients and communication, they just have 
all the resources they could ever want, and they send wave after wave of interns 
and TVC to hack their way through the product until it works.
