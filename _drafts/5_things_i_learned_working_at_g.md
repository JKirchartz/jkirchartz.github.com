title: 5 Things I Learned Working at G

In honor of my time at G, which is ending during peak listicle season, Here are 
5 things I learned working there.

#5. There are only 6 colors
Blue, Red, Yellow, Green, Black, White -- if you see a color that's not one of 
these, chances are it's not at G. Any lableling system there was 
limited to this group of colors, which makes sense, because it's their brand. The 
brand is strong.


#4. The Caste System is everywhere
There's FTEs (full time employees), Interns, then there's TVCs (Temps, Vendors, 
Contractors) - each gets a different colored badge. FTEs get to drink beers,
ride scooters, invite guests, and go to off-site events, even travel. TVCs
get none of that. Interns are in the middle, learning new things and 
working on projects, they may or may not get to contribute to a team, but 
they'll definitely learn a lot. All are expected to pick up skills on the go, 
but only employees and interns are *given* opportunities for self-improvement. 
At every single event that everybody in the office was invited to, 
another TVC would ask if we were allowed to be there, my only 
response: "Let's see if they kick us out." -- and we never were -- although 
there was always the awkward feeling like we were about to be...

#2. All meetings need an Agenda
Gers are diligent at creating an agenda for a meeting, where anybody could 
add any topic relevant to the meeting, and discuss actual relevant work - this 
is great for avoiding "Story-time with Fearless Leader"-style meetings where 
somebody has a captive audience to bore to death (which is more likely than 
you'd realize.)


#1. G has no Magic Mojo
G is exactly like every other company on the planet; They don't have any 
magic mojo to prevent problems with clients and communication, they just have 
all the resources they could ever want, and they send wave after wave of workers
to hack their way through the product until it works well enough for public 
consumption. Their only real power is cold hard cash, enough that they can do 
whatever they want and let failure roll off their backs.
