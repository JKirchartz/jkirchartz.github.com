The most useful git commands I've found, and how to use them (by my understanding)



## `git rebase -i`

interactive git rebasing

## git cherry-pick <hash>

git one commit and apply it to a branch

## git log --name-status HEAD^..HEAD

see what all happened in the last commit (without diffs)

## git reset HEAD --

unstage dumb stuff

## git diff --staged

see a diff between what's staged and what isn't

## git stash

put something away for a minute
