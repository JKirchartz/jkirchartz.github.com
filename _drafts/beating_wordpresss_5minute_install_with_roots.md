title: Beating Wordpress's 5-minute Install with Roots.io
published: false

Wordpress is famous for its five-minute install, but what if I told you that you
could create up to 3 servers running wordpress in almost the same amount of time?


The Roots.io stack consists of 3 elements
1. [Trellis][2] a fully stocked virtual machine for running wordpress
2. [Bedrock][3] a framework for setting up wordpress sites
3. [Sage][4] a highly customizable starter theme framework

but that's a lot of different bits glued together, it would definitely take far
too long to configure it all, and therein lies the power of my [rootsinit][1] script.
