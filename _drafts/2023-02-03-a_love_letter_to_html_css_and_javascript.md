<h1><s>A Love Letter to</s>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, a manifesto.</h1>

If you've read any of my other writings you've probably guessed my secret shame.

I am not a Real Programmer&tm;.<!--more-->

A Real Programmer&tm; could never take these toy seriously.  The web is just a
fad, real programs are compiled in dark terminals and guided by an occult hand.
Their inner workings are arcane knowledge, every bit is under the control of
these True Illuminates.

That stuff is all well and good. and fun to dabble with, but I love HTML, CSS,
and Javascript. The Triumvirate of Web Development. Over the past 30 years this
technology has proved itself & has infiltrated all of society, democratizing
information sharing.

## HTML

On October 29th, 1991, Tim Berners-Lee, published a document entitled [HTML
Tags.][1] The document contained a description of the first 18 HTML tags:
&lt;title&gt;, &lt;nextid&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;isindex&gt;, &lt;plaintext&gt;,
&lt;listing&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;&hellip;&lt;h6&gt;, &lt;address&gt;,
&lt;hp1&gt;, &lt;hp2&gt;&hellip;, &lt;dl&gt;, &lt;dt&gt;, &lt;dd&gt;,
&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;,&lt;menu&gt; and &lt;dir&gt;. Some how, some way, this
dialect of hypertext grew &ndash; escaped containment at CERN &ndash; and since
then has infected the world with this mind virus. [Wars][2] have been fought,
[Flames][3] have been thrown, Businesses, Nations, websites, and browsers have
come and gone. But the World Wide Web has stayed the same: a wilderness[^1].
Yes, some have tried to tame this wilderness and create their own silos - but
the web always strikes back with personal websites and weird projects.

By now HTML5 has expanded to [108][4] tags (not counting variants on type or
other attibutes), and incremental version numbers are no more! Long live the
[living standard!][5].

These are the bones of the web, the semantic structure that hold together text,
connects ideas.  This structure has meaning, these tags have semantics, and
this markup language is the code that helps elucidate this meaning.

Arguably, the worst hypertext system won, and many crimes have been committed
because of it (most of which did nothing to improve the hypertext, or the web,
but to make it more complicated and intimidating). But at least it allowed some
people to move beyond text & communicate in new and interesting ways.

## Javascript

Over the years, many add-ons to HTML have been developed. Java Applets in 1993,
Shockwave in 1995, Flash in 1996. All forgotten relics, Javascript won and
became [the standard][8].[^1]

What [more can I say about Javascript?][7] It's got it's own add-ons and
incorporations, there are polyfills and plugins to add missing functionality to
browers, it's the glue language of the web - grandchild of perl and shell
scripts, and all the other glue languages. One ring, not to rule them all, but
to connect them all.

If you don't like Javascript, don't worry! You don't have to write your app in
Javascript, you can compile plenty of different languages to [wasm][8] and then
use Javascript to run them on the web!


## CSS

Finally, the proverbial lipstick on the pig. Another hard-won battle that moved from aesthetic attributes on HTML elements and into a language of its own.

Constantly stuck between a world of print and screen design, over the years it took to create CSS3 it has somehow managed to do both, poorly.

CSS is easier than ever to use, but the weight of history makes it seem frighteningly large. There are many ways to skin this cat, but things we only dreamed of are now possible

    :root {
        --red: firebrick;
        --orange: orange;
        --yellow: gold;
        --light-blue: cyan;
        --blue: mediumblue;
        --purple: rebeccapurple;
        --green: olivedrab;
        --black: black;
    }

[^1]:  Or maybe technically Flash & Javascript tied and became ECMAscript which ate them both and spit out more Javascript APIs?
