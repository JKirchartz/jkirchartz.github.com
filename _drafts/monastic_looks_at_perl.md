Perl was created in 1987 by Larry Wall[^1] who described it as "a language for getting your job done."
In 1991, when [`Programming Perl`][2] was first published, Larry Wall's man page for perl went a little more in-depth, [describing it][1] like so:

> Perl is an interpreted language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files,
> extracting information from those text files, and printing reports based on
> that information. It's also a good language for many system management tasks.
> The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient, complete)
> rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal). It combines (in the author's
> opinion, anyway) some of the best features of C, sed, awk, and sh, so people
> familiar with those languages should have little difficulty with it.
> (Language historians will also note some vestiges of csh, Pascal, and even
> BASIC-PLUS.)

I'm not here to present a cronology of Perl over the years, I wasn't really
there for it, and [it's been done][3]. I remember some time the late 1990s when
I was first trying to become a "real programmer" that I picked up some "Learn
Perl in 24 hours" book, and not having much success in 24 hours put off the
whole thing for nearly 20 years. I've since learned to hack perl a bit and
started a job where perl is used extensively so I've been trying to wrap my
mind around it a bit more.

The title here alludes to the [Perl Monks][5] Community, which is themed after
a monastery. The comparison of hackers to other devotees is not new, the
Commodore had the "Guru Meditation Error," in [Steven Levy's "Hacker's"][6]
many people are refered to as "gurus," many workspaces are called "monasteries"
and the people who operated IBM mainframes were refered to as a "Priesthood,"

> and those privileged enough to submit data to those most holy priests were
> the official acolytes. It was an almost ritualistic exchange.
>
> > Acolyte: Oh machine, would you accept my offer of information so you may
> > run my program and perhaps give me a computation?
> >
> > Priest (on behalf of the machine): We will try. We promise nothing.

Larry Wall has never hidden his Christian faith, he's referenced it in his
extellent [speeches][7], but he's no fundamentalist hardliner thumping a bible,
he discusses a variety of ideas with wit, joy, reverance, and irreverance, and
I've found these talks to be infinitely fascinating.

You may be familiar with [Wall's "Three Virtues of a Programmer"][9]: Laziness,
Impatience and Hubris; but in his [second "State of the Onion"][10] he expands
on that with three virtues of community

> These are virtues of passion. They are not, however, virtues of community.
> The virtues of community sound like their opposites: diligence, patience, and
> humility.
>
> They're not really opposites, because you can do them all at the same time.
> It's another matter of perspective. These are the virtues that have brought
> us this far. These are the virtues that will carry our community into the
> future, if we do not abandon them.
>
> Basically, we just have to stay the course. Friedrich Nietzsche called it "a
> long obedience in the same direction", which is a good snappy slogan. But I
> like the full quote too:
>
> The essential thing "in heaven and earth" is ... that there should be long
> obedience in the same direction; there thereby results, and has always
> resulted in the long run, something which has made life worth living.
