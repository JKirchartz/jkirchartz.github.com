Perl was created in 1987 by Larry Wall who described it as "a language for getting your job done."
In 1991, when [`Programming Perl`][2] was first published, Larry Wall's man
page for perl 4.0 went a little more in-depth, [describing it][1] like so:

> Perl is an interpreted language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files,
> extracting information from those text files, and printing reports based on
> that information. It's also a good language for many system management tasks.
> The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient, complete)
> rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal). It combines (in the author's
> opinion, anyway) some of the best features of C, sed, awk, and sh, so people
> familiar with those languages should have little difficulty with it.
> (Language historians will also note some vestiges of csh, Pascal, and even
> BASIC-PLUS.)
