If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times...

Most people's problem with javascript isn't that it's bad programming language
despite what they say.

It turns out, they don't like it because it's not their preferred programming
language and has it's own set of quirks instead, and they're different from
that person's preferred language. Not everyone wants to be a polyglot
programmer, to paraphase Bill Gates, "One programming language should be enough
for anyone" - I mean, that's why node.js is so popular, right? You can run your
JS in the browser OR server - one language to rule them all!

### Ways people have tried to "fix" Javascript:

1. Coffeescript (ruby-like)
2. Typescript (C#-like)
3. PureScript (Haskell-like)
3. ClojureScript (Lisp-like)

3. Flow (add strong types to JS)
4. JSX (add html & css to JS)
5. asm.js (Compile C to JS)
3. Dart (Compile C to JS)
6. WebAssembly/WASM (Compile C/Rust/anything to something that works alongside JS)
