<p>Big Island Toyota has always been a little ahead of the curve on social media, They're involved with their community, and they use their website pro-actively. Here are 2 requested projects from them.</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="http://bigislandtoyota.com/youtube.cfm">YouTube page</a> from their
website. This was made with Coldfusion &amp; JQuery. The Coldfusion parses their
YouTube RSS feed, JQuery is used to show each video in a simple LightBox.</p>

<p>They also requested a <a href="http://bigislandtoyota.com/Auto_Blog.cfm">blog</a>, which
I developed with ColdFusion &amp; SQL. The front-end is a standard Content-
oriented design, with a contact link &amp; links to share their posts around the
web. The Back-end is just as simple to use, it uses the
<a href="http://ckeditor.com/">FCKeditor</a> (now renamed CKeditor) for Coldfusion to
provide a rich-text editor. There is also an RSS feed for the blog, although I
no longer have the access I need to find it.</p>
