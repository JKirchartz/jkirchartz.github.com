<p>If you didn't know <a href="http://tgimboej.org/">The Great Internet Migratory Box Of Electronics
Junk</a> is a project that allows hackers &amp; makers to share
some electronics/components with each other. There's a ton of these things
going around, but it seems like they move quite slowly.</p>

<p> I received the box code-named <a href="http://tgimboej.org/Box_Code:_Baltimore_Bazaar"><em>Baltimore
Bazaar</em></a> a few days ago &amp;
busted it open immediately; nothing really caught my eye in there, a few
motors, a batter charger and a bunch of small components EVERYWHERE. I had to
pick a bunch of capacitors and screws out of one of the motors I decided to
play with, but there was nothing in there I really wanted or needed.</p>

<p>I took a 2GB SD card out (I'm planning on adding the <a href="http://hbc.hackmii.com/">Homebrew
Channel</a> to my Wii), and replaced it with a couple
old-school RCA transistors, a small geared motor, a 20Q game (needs a new
battery), and a few ICs. I think I saw somewhere that you could hack the 20Q
device, I'm sure somebody can find a use for it.</p>

<p>Hopefully I get another box sometime in the future, it was fun trying to
figure out what everything is. Perhaps the next one will be more useful to me;
maybe I'll even split it, I've certainly got enough junk!</p>
