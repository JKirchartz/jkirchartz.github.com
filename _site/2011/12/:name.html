<p>Here's the <a href="http://www.pghhomebuilders.com/">Builders Association in the Metropolitan

<p>This little humdinger has a back end written with
<a href="http://python.org/">python</a>/<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a>, I'm
also using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/geopy/">geopy</a> to assist in calculating
distances for the map. The front end uses <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/">Google Maps
APIv3</a> HTML5 and
CSS3. Django's built-in admin back end made data-entry a breeze, although I
wish it had built-in table alteration, changing your models is a pain in the
butt, I didn't want to figure out <a href="http://south.aeracode.org/">South</a> with
very little data to migrate.</p>

<p>This was my first time running an <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a> server, it's a
big difference from apache. The configs are a lot cleaner, definitely more
like python than markup. The <a href="http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/">uwsgi</a> was used
to run python and since it's packaged with nginx setup was a breeze. The
Database was in postgres, although I could've used
<a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">postGIS</a> to do the distance calculations and
bypass geopy, I was already in too deep to change it. This is a pretty nice
stack.</p>

<p>I kept the design minimal and fluid to support the widest array of browsers.
Django's templating is awesome, you can do a lot with it without getting in
the way of your html.</p>
