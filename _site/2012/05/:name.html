<p><em>I wrote this piece in October of 2011 for the <a href="http://blog.songwhale.com/post/11316955561/webtechnology">Songwhale Blog</a>, re-posting it here for prosperity.</em></p>

<p>The times they are a-changin’. Every day our technology becomes more advanced
as we push into the future; it wasn’t too long ago that yahoo looked like
<a href="http://www.topdesignmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/118.jpg%5D">this</a> and
an <a href="http://www.ipodhistory.com/ipod-first-generation/">iPod</a> held 512mb, five
years before that NewsWeek <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1995/02/26/the-internet-%0Abah.html">published an
article</a> skeptical that anyone would choose to read electronic publications.
The future is coming, and if you want to fight it we’ll read your comments 15
years later and laugh hysterically. The web has proven itself to be a living
creature, mutating every day as people discover new uses for the web’s core
technologies, and browsers become more advanced to handle new additions like
html5 and css3.</p>

<p>You’ve gotta stay on top of these things and change as the web changes. Of
course it’s ridiculous to assume you can figure out all these things yourself,
so let’s refer to the internets’ hive-mind.</p>

<p>Javascript and HTML have been with the web since the beginning so they’re kind
of a big deal. Weekly updates on what’s new in the world of Javascript and
HTML5 are available from <a href="http://javascriptweekly.com/">Javascript Weekly</a> and
<a href="http://html5weekly.com/">HTML5 weekly</a>, all the industry’s rock-stars have
something good to say about these newsletters. Another excellent resource is
<a href="http://www.hackernewsletter.com/">Hacker Newsletter</a>, a weekly best-of
selection of articles from <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. This
one covers the web, as well as software and hardware news and other topics of
interest to computer geeks. There are many more newsletters out there worth
reading though, so if your inbox is screaming “Feed Me!” you should check out
<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/07/15/email-newsletters-%0Aworth-subscribing-to/">this list</a> at Smashing Magazine.</p>

<p>If newsletters are not your thing, or not enough <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List
Apart</a> and <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/07/15/email-newsletters-worth-%0Asubscribing-to/">Smashing
Magazine</a> offer a lot of free information on web technologies and
techniques. Smashing magazine’s daughter-blog <a href="http://www.noupe.com/">Noupe</a>
has an A.D.D.-like selection covering all areas of design, development,
inspiration, and tutorials. For pure design
<a href="http://www.notcot.org/"></a><a href="http://www.notcot.org/">Notcot</a> and
<a href="http://www.juxtapoz.com/"></a> <a href="http://www.juxtapoz.com/">Juxtapoz</a> are updated
very, very often. These guys all have a writing/curation staff so they cover a
lot of ground.</p>

<p>For a more personal touch you should check out individuals who are outstanding
in their field.  The design-specific <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%5Bhttp://www.swiss-miss.com/">Swiss
Miss</a> offers a ton of
inspiration and distraction to get your creative juices flowing. <a href="http://snook.ca/">Jonathan
Snook</a> and <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/">456 berea
street</a> are more focused on development, but
never disappoint. If you want pure unadulterated inspiration, no matter what
field you specialize in, <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a> is king.</p>

<p>No matter where you look on the web, there’s always more to learn, so don’t
assume you could ever know everything. After all you know what they say about
making assumptions…</p>
