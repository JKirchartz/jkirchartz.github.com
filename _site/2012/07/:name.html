<p>There, I said it. Now get the phrase out of your head, it doesn't exist, please stop trying.
Far too often you'll hear some paraphrasing of the complaint "But it doesn't look like it did in Photoshop"</p>

<h2>Well, Why not?</h2>

<p>For starters, a web browser <strong>isn't</strong> Photoshop; but pixel-perfect design is
still unattainable. I mean what <em>is</em> a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel">pixel</a>? splitting the word "pix-el" is
short for Picture Element, the smallest unit of a picture. Chances are you're
reading this on a computer, it's monitor probably has square pixels; but look
closely at your TV and you might see rectangular pixels, magnify your
newspaper and you'll find round ones. If you happen to have a newer MacBook /
iPhone / iPad, they use the amazing <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/retina-display.html">Retina
display</a> which packs
4 pixels in the place of 1. This unit of measurement is vastly different in
every format, and we haven't even left the sofa.</p>

<p>(each set of 3 colors is a pixel)</p>

<h2>Moving the Web Forward</h2>

<p>In our current market place, there are hundreds of web-ready devices and
smartphones (and <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/go/1132/">refrigerators</a>) that are
trying to access your site. Unfortunately this also causes problems because
the screen dimensions on these devices vary greatly. As time passes this
fragmentation problem will probably only get worse.</p>

<p>This graph is just screen dimensions for Android phones! Nevermind the
completely proprietary nature of <a href="http://www.phonescoop.com/glossary/term.php?gid=310">feature
phones</a> and the world of
tablets. You have absolutely no control over the screen dimensions your client
is using, or what resolution they're running, because of this there is no way
to do a pixel-perfect design that looks <em>good</em> everywhere. If you try prepare
to spend your resources on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk7yqlTMvp8">herding
cats</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>For me, “ideal” on the web isn’t about pixel-perfection anymore, but about
seeking the most pragmatic approach to balancing different kinds of content
with an ever-increasing number of screen sizes and resolutions. - <a href="http://trentwalton.com/2012/06/19/fluid-type/">Trent

<h2>What's the solution?</h2>

<p>It's just not possible to plan for every single device, so you'll just have to
embrace uncertainty. <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles%0A/responsive-web-design/">Responsive design</a> will help adapt, but it has its
<a href="http://www.webdesignshock.com/responsive-design-problems/">problems</a>, you
could also make a separate mobile site (and you <em>could</em> make that responsive),
mix solutions until you find what works for you and your client. There's more
planning and experimentation in developing for the web today than there was a
decade ago, and who knows what the future will bring. Technology is there to
help, even if it does complicate things sometimes.</p>
