It's no secret, I'm VIM fan. Any time I have to take my hands off the keyboard to mess with a GUI I have issues.
My palms get all sweaty, I break out in hives, and have a vague feeling like I'm playing a game of whack-a-mole.
I've got a 3 monitor setup at work. Just finding the cursor on this vast plane feels like an epic quest.
I'm sick of it. So I decided to do something about it.

I split my time almost equally been my editor and my browser, why not use the same shortcuts?
Enter [Vimium](http://vimium.github.io), a customizable Google Chrome extension that gives you vim-like control over your browser.
All the scrolling is spot on, even `G` and `gg` scroll you to the bottom or top of the page, respectively.
