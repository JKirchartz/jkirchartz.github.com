Patents were an excellent idea, write out how you did something new and different, and
you could register for a limited monopopoly on that development. After your monopoly ran out
others could then look at your patent and come up with new ideas using your old work.

Now though patents aren't used for diseminating information, but to keep it a secret and
to lock out your competition. As Apple did in it's recent case against Samsung. Apple is
afraid of competition, that's why they're trying to pass injuntions anywhere Samsung's
products are going to market. If you can't compete litigate.

The fashion industry doesn't have patents, you can't patent a t-shirt or a necklace or the cut of a dress.
Every year thousands of knock-offs are sold world-wide, and it doesn't hurt the industry a bit. This 
hasn't destroyed the industry but caused it to thrive. How can this be if innovation has to be tied up 
in legal mumbo-jumbo? Simple: fashion changes.

Every year a new set of colors and styles is strutted in high fashion shows in New York, LA, Paris,
and Milan. Frivolent costumes and simple shapes in a bevy of colors and patterns. Every year the combinations
change based solely on the whims of the high fashion designer. You are your brand, and your reputation is at 
stake. The high fashion designers cuts and colors are then replicated by high-end stores, who are copied by 
regular retailers, who eventually show up in bargain retailers. Each step of the industry is supported by the step before it
as ideas spread to the masses.

This was the ideal of the Atomic age capitalism presided over by the Greatest Generation. Every years designers would
produce everything from new toasters to cars, each pushing the boundaries of product design. Futuristic radios that looked
as well suited on a space-ship as they did next to a sleak console hi-fi system. The designs and implementations varied
wildly as new technologies and cultural whims were discovered. Everything changes just as much as it stays the same.

There's only 12 notes in the western musical scale, yet everything from Mozart to the Beatles to Method Man can be found within. Each of these
builds upon the past for the betterment of the future. We can all prosper if we let information flow freely.

There are only so many ways to cut a shirt, just as there are only so many ways to write a program. 
Why hold onto your baby forever? Once it matures, set it free to the world.
