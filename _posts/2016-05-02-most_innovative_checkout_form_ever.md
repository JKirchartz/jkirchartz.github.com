I don't know if you're ready for this - it might blow your mind&hellip;
<!--more-->


* Name: [ Full Name (as seen on card) ]
* Billing Address: [ Full Address ]
* Shipping Address (if different): [ Full Address ]
* Credit Card #: [ can't you guess? ]
* CCV: [ verification # from the back of the card ]


Kablooie! That's all you need! Seriously - Don't take 6 pages and 23 forms - just get the sale &amp; be done with it!
One field is more than enough for each type of information, if you need it split out you can parse it on the backend ([We have the technology][1]), it doesn't have to be a front-end issue.
You can even help the user input this information in the appropriate [format][2] if you want, just make sure you account for all possibilities (i.e. full zipcode: #####-####)
Don't leave room for doubt, nobody has time for that, so don't forget to always be closing!
