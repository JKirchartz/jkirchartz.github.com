Here's a little html5 notepad using [localStorage](http://caniuse.com/#namevalue-storage). [Check it out](http://jkirchartz.com/demos/HTML5notepad.html)<!--more-->

</script>

Lines 28 &amp; 30 handle saving and retrieving the
[localStorage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Storage) data, It's supported
on ie8+ as well as all modern browsers. Works on Android &amp; iPhone too. Lines
32-34 call the save function in 3 different ways to ensure your information is
saved automagically (I get a little paranoid like that) Line 5 &amp; lines 20-23
ensure this works on older browsers, but we don't really need most of it so
really we could minimize this down to

</script>

Which is short enough to be in bookmarklet territory, unfortunately
localStorage doesn't work with the local file protocol, [the
spec](http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/#the-localstorage-attribute) says it
needs a scheme/host/port to work for security reasons.

Local storage is just too easy NOT to use.
