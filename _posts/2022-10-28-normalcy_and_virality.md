I have a confession. I am a poster. I post. Sometimes, I even shitpost. This is
a story about two shitposts. Both alike in dignity. The ask was simple: "Are
you normal? Please repost for reach." One posted to [Twitter][1], the other to
[Mastodon][2].<!--more--> There wasn't much thought put into it... I clarified in the
replies on Twitter, and in the post on Masto itself, that I have no intended
definition for "normalcy;" as one person replied, "normal is only a setting on
a clothes dryer."

While the polls were running, I was struck by the difference in how much
interaction each post was generating. The spread on each on each platform was
radically different. Sure, I reposted on each network and harassed my friends
to spread them; but on Mastodon I had nearly 6 times the number of responses I
had on Twitter. The results of the poll were fairly clear on each network -
about 20% of people are normal, and 80% are not normal. [80/20 seems fairly normal][7]

I've seen Twitter power-users complaining that they couldn't "go viral" on
Mastodon, but that didn't seem to be a problem for me. I joined Twitter in
2009, and have roughly 1400 followers there. I've been active on Mastodon since
2017, have moved instances at least once, and have roughly 400 followers.
Because of this, I'll be the first to admit that I have a leg up on new users
of either platform with my modest follower-counts. I've had several bots live
and die on Twitter, some are now on Mastodon, I know first hand that each
follower is hard-won. I'm just some dork that makes stuff, stuff that posts. I
don't even do a very good job at posting content, I don't even think of sharing
most of the things I do.  I'm not a brand or anything, I'm just a normal
person.

Well, I'm normal in the sense that I'm an average, non-famous, not very
popular, but not unpopular, regular Joe Schmoe nobody. I'm also normal in the
sense that I don't think of myself as normal at all. I may have influenced the
data, the replies to the polls might have influenced the data, this was a very
unscientific poll -- but the majority of respondents (80-82%!) replied that
they did not consider themselves a "normal person," whatever that means to
them. A few of the people who reported themselves as "Normal" went on to
explain how they are very unique individuals like everyone else or that
abnormal was normal, and the data seems to back that up.

Noticeably, Mastodon doesn't have Analytics like Twitter does. Mastodon does not
prioritize showing anything more than re-posts and favorites. There is no
accounting of how many people viewed a post or other metrics that advertisers
are interested in. Each post is an entity unto itself, ruled by the tides of
the social network and the waves your content can make. Every time somebody
outside of your instance interacts with the post it's spread to more and more
federated timelines. There is no "Hotness" metric to combat to keep people
interested, the spread is more organic - like trees connecting to mycelium and
other roots creating a network effect in the ecology of the forest. A post to
Mastodon is a post to the [Fediverse][3], every other ActivityPub-connected
website.

Whether or not Twitter crumbles, the fediverse has thousands and thousands of
servers. There's no real risk in [finding a mastodon instance][4] and/or
[checking to see if your Twitter friends are already there][5]. Like I
mentioned, you can [change instances][6] if you find a better community, a more
trustworthy or friendly admin, or even just a domain you prefer.

Sorry, this is now an advertisement for decentralized open-source social media,
but I have no faith whatsoever in Elon Musk's handling of Twitter. I'll ride it
out to see what I missed during the death of MySpace, out of morbid curiosity,
and the ability to mock Elon directly on his own personal $44 billion quagmire.
