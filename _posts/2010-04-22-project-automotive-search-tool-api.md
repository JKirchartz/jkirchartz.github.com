Here is a template I created for use on car dealership mobile sites. It's a
minimalist design, made to work on the widest variety of software/firmware
possible. This template was developed to launch quickly, if the dealer had an
existing site, it was simply a the flick of the switch to launch. To maximize
compatibility there is no JavaScript used on this, since only a handful of
smartphones support it. Every step through this project was fully optimized
for load time on non-3G networks. As of today this site is  live and can be
found at [findlaytoyota.com/mobile](http://findlaytoyota.com/mobile), or by
visiting [findlaytoyota.com](http://findlaytoyota.com/) from your mobile
phone.
