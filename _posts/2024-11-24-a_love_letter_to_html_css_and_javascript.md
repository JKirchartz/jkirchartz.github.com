<h1><s>A Love Letter</s>... a manifesto(?)</h1>

If you've read any of my other writings you've probably guessed my secret shame.

I am not a Real Programmer &tm;.<!--more-->

A Real Programmer &tm; could never take these toy web browsers seriously. The
web is just a fad, real programs are compiled in dark terminals and guided by
an occult hand. Their inner workings are arcane knowledge, every bit is under
the control of these True Illuminates. And so web developers have worked hard
to become Real Programmers, cramming all their code into JSX and Typescript
files, running builds, generating boilerplate with commandline tools.

That stuff is all well and good, I've worked with these modern stacks, but I
love HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The True Triumvirate of Web Development. Over
the past 30 years this technology has proved itself & has infiltrated all of
society, democratizing information sharing. Social Media's walled gardens
promised connection but [became an arena for gladiators][26], the algorithms
became a way for sensationalism to run rampant, a more [insidious
rumor mill][28] than any [yellow journalist][27] could've imagined.

## HTML

On October 29th, 1991, Tim Berners-Lee, published a document entitled [HTML
Tags.][1] The document contained a description of the first 18 HTML tags:
&lt;title&gt;, &lt;nextid&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;isindex&gt;, &lt;plaintext&gt;,
&lt;listing&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;&hellip;&lt;h6&gt;, &lt;address&gt;,
&lt;hp1&gt;, &lt;hp2&gt;&hellip;, &lt;dl&gt;, &lt;dt&gt;, &lt;dd&gt;,
&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;,&lt;menu&gt; and &lt;dir&gt;. Some how, some way, this
dialect of hypertext grew &ndash; escaped containment at CERN &ndash; and since
then has infected the world with this mind virus. [Wars][2] have been fought,
[Flames][3] have been thrown, [Businesses][29], [Nations][9], [websites][10], and [browsers][30] have
come and gone. But the World Wide Web has stayed the same: a wilderness[^1].
Yes, some have tried to tame this wilderness and create their own silos - but
the web always strikes back with personal websites and weird projects.

By now HTML5 has expanded to [108][4] tags (not counting variants on type or
other attibutes or user-defined tags), and incremental version numbers are no
more! Long live the [living standard!][5].

These are the bones of the web, the [semantic structure][12] that hold together
text, connects ideas. By "Semantic" we mean that the structure itself has
meaning, separating and combining ideas typographically, visually, and for the
visually impaired. If we decorate the semantics structure correctly, we can
make the [data more useful for machines][13] and [more accessible to
people][14].


## Javascript

Over the years, many add-ons to HTML have been developed. Java Applets in 1993,
Shockwave in 1995, Flash in 1996. All forgotten relics, Javascript won and
became [the standard][8].[^1] It was created in 10 days, copied by
Actionscript, and then flipped the industry on it's head as Node.

What [more can I say about Javascript?][7] It's taken web developers from "Fake
Programmers" to "Real Programmers" It's got it's own add-ons and
incorporations, can be used server-side and to build command-line tools, there
are polyfills and plugins to add missing &amp; new functionality to browers,
it's the glue language of the web &mdash; it was inspired by Scheme put wound
up something more like Perl. One ring, not to rule them all, but to connect
them all, any way you want.

If you don't like Javascript, don't worry! You don't have to write your app in
Javascript, you can compile plenty of different languages to [wasm][8] and then
use Javascript to run them on the web!

(update 2026: love it or hate it, Claude & ChatGPT Codex both use JS/npm for their TUI/CLI apps)

## CSS

Finally, the proverbial lipstick on the pig. Another hard-won battle that moved
from aesthetic attributes on HTML elements and into a language of its own, the
&lt;font&gt; tag is long gone.

Constantly stuck between a world of print and screen design, over the years it
took to create CSS3 it has somehow managed to do both, poorly. It used to be
difficult to do things like [centering , and 3-column layouts.][17] But now CSS
is easier than ever to use, even if the weight of history makes it seem
frighteningly large. There are many ways to skin this cat, but things we only
dreamed of are now possible - like [centering, and 3-column layouts.][18] The
[old ugly hacks are dead][16], and new ugly hacks have incredible potential.

## The Love

Simple, compact, and easier to write than ever; the core components of the web
belong to us all. [Large codebases that never stop growing][25] and obscure the
source on big mainstream websites, compiled from something not entirely unlike
JavaScript, or just the ad-strewn wasteland of our modern online dystopia; but
there is still a [smaller][21] [simpler][22] [bespoke][23] [internet][19]
[universe][20], hidden right below all around these [ivory towers][24], if you
know where to look. Simple hand-crafted code, that you yourself can read,
learn from, and write yourself. Not limited to the restraints of a platform,
raw and unmoderated, pure creativity, where a coder can still be free.

[^1]: Or maybe technically Flash & Javascript tied and became ECMAscript which ate them both and spit out more Javascript APIs?
[^2]: RIP IE 5.5 for Mac OS 9, an elegant weapon for a more civilized age &mdash; the quirks were never better.
