[Baierl Automotive](http://baierl.com/) and [MarkIT Group](http://markitgroupmedia.blogspot.com/) developed the idea for a [Youtube](http://youtube.com/) Video contest, with a raffle for [FaceBook](http://facebook.com/) fans.<!--more-->

The outline was to have a customer from a mailing list become a fan on facebook, and upload a home-made video to enter
for a chance to win a trip for 2 to Las Vegas. During the course of this
project the requirements and design changed many times, as well as the
deadline. Eventually the contest became a raffle for 2 tickets to Vegas, a
video contest to win 2 tickets to Vegas, and it was opened to the public. It
was developed with ColdFusion, Javascript, and JQuery & [1kb
Grid](http://www.1kbgrid.com/) in the course of one week, with additional
tweaks each time the requirements, contest, and design changed. See for
