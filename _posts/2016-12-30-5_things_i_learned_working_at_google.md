I worked at Google in 2015 and learned a great deal of things, I wrote this
shortly after; now I think it's finally ready to publish.<!--more-->

# Post-Mortems
Failures need to be investigated so you can learn from them and avoid making
the same mistake in the future. Any time you create a program there are
eventually going to be human errors, perhaps a cavalcade of human errors.
Firing the developer for a bug after code-review and QA approved their work
isn't going to fix anything. If there's an error in the workflow that causes
people to step on each other's toes or causes stress for the team it needs to
be discussed to avoid repeating the same problem in the future. If somebody
made a mistake they might not have even known, it's just not possible to
predict everything software's going to face in the real world. Learn from your
mistakes, don't point fingers to find a scapegoat, and shrug &mdash; fix it.

# Meetings
Meetings need itineraries, start/end times, and people need to stick to
them. Creating an agenda for a meeting in a shared doc allows everybody to put
a blurb/links to their issues to discuss during the meeting. A meeting can go
5 minutes over, but shouldn't go much further, schedule additional meetings if
more discussion is required. This agenda can even be edited any time during
the meeting if something that warrants further discussion comes up. It's great
for avoiding bad meeting formats like "Random Story Time" or "Pages of
Meaningless Numbers." The agenda keeps meetings from being a waste of time, if
you want to waste time schedule a "Sync Up" meeting with a small group and enjoy.

# Google isn't its Mythology
Google is pretty much like every other company on the planet, except with more
people and more money. They make a bunch of neat tools (for themselves first
&ndash; eating their own dogfood) but don't have anything super special to
prevent problems with clients, communication, workflow, or staffing. Managers
and teams have opportunities to discuss and modify how things work, but
everybody has their own style and they're allowed to work with it. There were
no trick questions at my interview, they had me do FizzBuzz and some regexes.

# The Caste System
I've read things before about the heirarchy of employees at the big G, but
first-hand I saw FTEs, Interns, then there's TVCs (Temps, Vendors, Contractors)
&mdash; each gets a different colored badge. Interns get a specific problem to
solve. FTEs get to drink beers, ride scooters, invite guests, go to off-site
events, and even get Christmas gifts. TVCs get none of that, for legal reasons.
I was a contractor, not a Google employee, as part of their orientation I was
told I worked "at" and for the benefit of Google, but very specifically not "for"
Google. At every single event that the entire office was invited to another TVC
would ask if we were allowed to be there, We were never expelled.

# It's just business
As a contractor, I had a pretty good idea of when a year contract would expire,
but I didn't know if it'd be renewed or not. I was mistaken in-so-much as my
year contract was only scheduled to last 11 months, ending a little over a
month before Christmas. I'd seen contractors leave, and some return; so I
wasn't sure what was going to happen. During my last 2 weeks the word was
funding for the next year wasn't determined yet so my contract would not be
renewed. My last week I received applause and gratitude for my work in our
regular meetings. Not two weeks after my contract ended another staffing firm
contacted me for the same position, this time earning a little over of half what
I was making before &mdash; after all, it's just business.
