I worked with Google in 2015, and learned a few "best practices" about how

# Post-Mortems
Failures need to be investigated so you can learn from them and avoid making
the same mistake in the future. Any time you create a program there are
eventually going to be human errors, perhaps a cavalcade of human errors.
Firing the developer for a bug after code-review and QA approved their work
isn't going to fix anything. If there's an error in the workflow that causes
people to step on each other's toes or causes stress for the team it needs to
be discussed to avoid repeating the same problem in the future. If somebody
made a mistake they might not have even known, it's just not possible to
predict everything software's going to face in the real world. Learn from your
mistakes, don't point fingers to find a scapegoat, and shrug &mdash; fix it.

# Meetings
Meetings are weekly or as-needed, have itineraries and pre-defined start/end
times, and people need to stick to them. Creating an agenda for a meeting in a
shared Google Doc allows everybody to put a blurb/links to their issues to
discuss during the meeting, and keeps an important log of decisions made in
previous meetings. A meeting might go 5 minutes over but not much further,
additional time is scheduled if any overflow demands attention, if not
it's pushed to the next week's agenda. This agenda can even be edited any time
during the meeting if something that warrants further discussion comes up. It's
great for avoiding bad meeting formats like "Random Story Time" or "Pages of
Meaningless Numbers." The agenda keeps meetings from rambling, time if a
valuable resource, if you want a more informal chat over a game of pool or
whatever, schedule a "Sync Up" meeting, you don't always need a room or a
laptop to be productive. Everyone was always available and helpful over Google
Chat &amp; all the small stuff got settled without

# Google isn't its Mythology
Google is pretty much like every other company on the planet, except with more
of _everything_. They make a bunch of neat tools (often for themselves
first &ndash; eating their own dogfood) but don't have anything super special
to prevent problems with clients, communication, workflow, or staffing.
Managers and teams have opportunities to discuss and modify how things work,
but everybody has their own style and they're allowed to work with it. There
were none of those "brain teasers" interview questions they were once famous for that many
businesses still ask. [Google banned them because they didn't
help](https://io9.gizmodo.com/why-google-banned-brainteasers-from-their-interview-pro-576334070),
they had me do FizzBuzz and some regexes.

# The Caste System
I've read things before about the heirarchy of employees at the big G, but
first-hand I saw FTEs, Interns, then there's TVCs (Temps, Vendors, Contractors)
&mdash; each gets a different colored badge. Interns get a specific problem to
solve. FTEs get to drink beers, ride scooters, invite guests, go to off-site
events, and even get Christmas gifts. TVCs get none of that, for legal reasons.
I was a contractor, not a Google employee, as part of their orientation I was
told I worked "at" and for the benefit of Google, but very specifically not "for"
Google. At every single event that the entire office was invited to another TVC
would ask if we were allowed to be there, but we were never expelled or reprimanded.
Everyone has access to free gourmet meals &amp; unlimited coffee, soft drinks, and snacks.

# It's just business
As a contractor, I had a pretty good idea of when a year contract would expire,
but I didn't know if it'd be renewed or not. I was mistaken in-so-much as my
year contract was only scheduled to last 11 months, ending a little over a
month before Christmas. I'd seen contractors leave, and some return; so I
wasn't sure what was going to happen. During my last 2 weeks the word was
funding for the next year wasn't determined yet so my contract would not be
renewed. My last week I received applause and gratitude for my work in our
regular meetings. Not two weeks after my contract ended another staffing firm
contacted me for the same position, this time earning a little over of half what
I was making before &mdash; after all, it's just business.
