[Google unceremoniously killed Reader](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html). 
It was fun while it lasted, but you knew it was going to happen. 
I've been using Reader to keep up with my feeds for a long time; sometimes ignore them for weeks, but still skim for the best. 
The closure was hardly the hardest part. 
That respect does to when Google originally decided to start damaging Reader with a redesign in late 2011. 
This redesign brought in the new google black bar, and partially replaced the [social aspect](http://www.buzzfeed.com/robf4/googles-lost-social-network) with Google Plus. 
Up until then you could share articles with your friends, only if they actually wanted to see them.
I was great for discovering things from new perspectives, and for trading the best feeds to follow But G+ never really filled the gap. 
It was a separate entity and integration into Reader went out the window with this announcement.
Google Plus won't be filling in any gaps either.

The major losses here are in [China &amp; Iran](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130314/08462522321/unintended-consequences-google-reader-shutdown-losing-key-tool-to-get-around-censored-internet-iran-china.shtml)
where it was being used to circumvent oppressive regime's policies, so I can hardly compare my plight.

So now to fill this new hole in my life, there were a few solutions offered as replacements that I tried.

* [Pulse](http://pulse.me)

   It's ok, you can only import reader feeds from the app, not the website, which forced me to make some room on my phone. 
   Sadly I had to add each feed individually to new or existing pages, I couldn't just reuse the folders from Reader.
   And that's where I found my other problem, you can only have so many feeds on a page; Resulting in pages like "Dev2" and "Dev3".
   The interface here expects an image to give you the title over, and each feed is given it's own line and only shows a few articles each. 
   I just want one feed where I can see it all, and this isn't it. 
   It'd be great if all your content had a descriptive picture, unfortunely most of what I read doesn't.
   If you love Windows 8 Metro, you'll like Pulse.
* [Prismatic](http://getprismatic.com)

   You can connect your Reader account here by signing up or signing in with Google.
   However that's not quite obvious, and is more of a lucky happenstance for connecting your Google account.
   Unfortunately again you have to add your interests or favorite sites manually.
   Prismatic isn't an RSS reader, it's an article suggestion tool, based on interests in your feed. 
   The social ascpect is cool, and there's always a ton of interesting content, but this isn't a feed reader.
* [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com/)

   Amazing feed reader, similar keyboard shortcuts to Reader, and other features are close.
   The Title's view is almost exactly like Reader's compact view, which is my favorite.
   There's phone apps, browser apps, and web access here, so you can always read your feed.
   This is nearly a drop-in replacement for Google Reader, and it imports your feeds automatically, like a good app should.

I think I've found my man here with Feedly, I'm really enjoying it and the learning curve from Reader is nearly non-existent.
