It's been a long time coming since 2009, when I first tweeted

> Checking out twitter for no real reason other than to play with micro-blogging

Back then all of the posts were under 140 characters because they were sent and
received as individual SMS text messages. In less than a week of my first tweet
I was playing with the Twitter API<!--more--> &amp; attempting to connect it to Flickr.
Twitter didn't even show images yet, just links &mdash; some sites popped up
just to host photos and short-links to better fit twitter's post-length
restrictions. The web was free, open, and interoperable part of the real world
for the first time; what a time to be alive. Sadly, so much from from that era
are dead now &mdash; especially links, [entire websites lost to the sands of
time][10] through digital decay.

We all had a lot fun along the way, liveposting all our meals and bathroom
breaks to the world and confusing all the traditional media players through our
microblogging shenanigans, communities and classes formed around making twitter
bots, business popped up all over that ran on the platform, it became a live
action newscenter, then it turned into a cultural powerhouse. Twitter was
exciting, until the culture wars began and the world's wealthiest crybaby got
his feelings hurt by the consequences of his own actions &amp; unfunniness and
decided to ruin it for the rest of us, buying and gutting Twitter & rebuilding
it in his image, as it X. I thought for sure the site would crash and burn
right then, as he tore out pieces without understanding them, and expelled most
of the people who held deep institutional knowledge on a whim - but apparently
he hired enough of them back to stave off disaster.

Elon Musk said he wanted more Free Speech, really he wanted [more
attention][4], a new timeline popped up where the algorithm could push [posts
Musk wanted you to see][1] whether you followed the account or not, he wanted
more boosts so he had his team goose his numbers, he didn't like being blocked,
so he removed blocking (enabling stalkers and trolls), he created a new [AI
that will soon feed][3] on all the data Twitter has access to, and sell it to
3rd parties. Bit by bit he killed off what little protections Twitter had and
turned it to his nefarious will.  It was a powergrab.

With that API and others I built bots to share/promote local events, food
trucks, tell bad jokes, write bad poetry, promote subreddits, pretend to be
human, and now they're all gone - the first good part of Twitter to truly die.
The good times for bot-makers & academic researchers ended on Feb 2nd 2023 when
Elon Musk pulled the plug on Twitter's free and open APIs to "cut down on
spam." The problem is, the spam persisted.  Even worse, the spam started coming
from the platform itself. Advertised posts started appearing with Community
Notes telling people that they linked to a dropshipping scam and the product
was of lower quality and offered at cheaper prices elsewhere. The Spam was
probably intentional, you see Elon paid more than what Twitter was worth, so
our fun cheeky bots that posted art and jokes and poetry and worked research
projects that had a direct connection to the general public had to die so that
he could afford to pay the piper.

Musk's been posting more and more [deranged things][11], boosting [racist
far-right propaganda][5] &amp; conspiracy theories [personally and
algorithmically][2], re-instating banned far-right[^1] accounts while banning
accounts that oppose them, he even joined Trump's political campaign[^2]. Now,
Musk's newfound interest in politics has led to him getting a newly invented
job in a shiny new "Department of Government Efficiency" ([DOGE, like the
cryptocurrency meme/scam Musk runs][16]) government agency, despite him already
being a government contractor through his other tech firms this is somehow not
a conflict of interest. Conflicts of interest don't seem to matter much in the
government anymore, and the party of small government doesn't seem to mind
creating new departments and massive deportation programs.

But what about my "eX" ... well, I won't contribute to a project like this, at
all.  My twitter account has been mostly inactivate, logging on is like getting
hit in the face with a mud pie, so I'm going to delete it. nyhow, [the
Fediverse][7] is more fun, more focused, more interesting &mdash; a [better
quality of life all around][17].  Moderators are accountable and available and
doing their jobs. [I've been there for a few years now][8] - moving some of my
old twitter bots and reworking their brains and trying new ideas - most of [the
best of old twitter][9] is now [federated, thanks activitypub!][18] Now
even [Reputable][12] [Media][13] and [celebrities][14] are [fleeing][15],
[Twitter is dead and X can go with it.][6]
