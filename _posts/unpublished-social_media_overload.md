You won't want to miss this! Don't miss a thing! Keep in touch with ALL your friends! Never miss an update!
Why!? Why do we need to suck in so much information? Most of it is useless irrelevant crap (Trust me, I'm a "Social Media Expert")
It's not exactly all "Making a massive BM, #lol #omg #wtf #pooptweeting #hashtag", but pretty close.
Everybody's vying for your time and attention, everybody has something clever to say, or not-so-clever as the case may be.
Why should you worry about it?
