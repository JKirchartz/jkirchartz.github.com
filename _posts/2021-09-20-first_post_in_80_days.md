100 days to offload is going slower than expected. Two completely separate
extended-family situations hoisted house-hunting and home repair upon me the
past few months, but that's no excuse - I could've written about<!--more--> the homes I
was seeing, maybe even come up with some witty comparison between home projects
and legacy websites. The book club I've been in has spun off a few projects,
like stamp-making/letterboxing, watching movies, and it's own writing and
research; and the structure of the group has been tempting me to pick up
_another_ book that's discussed on another day. I've also got a RasPi I've been
setting using to experiment with my music equipment as a headless all-in-one
jambox. I've always got plenty of pokers in the fire, let alone all the other
projects that are on the back-burner indefinitely, and not to mention my
never-ending battle maintaining the family toilet[^1]. I'm only writing this
because I realized that the hour I've been spending with my kids at the park
can be used to write on my laptop - but an hour of writing is a lot less fun
than an hour of playing with my kids.

There was a time when a blog post might just be a Youtube video, or a few
pictures of your cat. This blog is supposed to be at least somewhat more
professional than that. A display of my knowledge and abilities, but as a
computer nerd that means I should be explaining something nerdy in detail and
I'm just not interested in that.  I could submit some of these articles to
various aggregators, maybe somebody out there subscribes over RSS, but I'd
rather not pay the price for being wrong[^2] on the internet, I'm wrong often
enough as it is. Search engines know where I am, and if this site helps
somebody out there with anything I'd be elated, but I'm not trying to be some
internet micro-celebrity.

Elation is the goal of most of my projects, mostly whatever brings *me* joy. By
day I hack for my employer, by night I hack for me - but I've been doing a lot
more for me than I used to, and not just to advance my career[^3]. I just want
to make cool stuff and share it with people, often online. I have dreams of
having gallery shows of my art or live performances of my music, but I don't
work towards that, I have no interest in being famous, I just want to find the
others. I can't spend all day looking for them, maybe being online will help them
find me. There's plenty of like-minded individuals out there to bring wildly
different things to the table.

The point is, while I spent so long ignoring people to hone my skills with
computers, I've been coming to the computer more and more to be with other
people on a level deeper than follower/followee. I don't want to "make content"
I want to create and innovate, and despite what we've been told about great
figures from history[^4], it's impossible to do that all alone.

I don't want to regale you with trite cliches, but I'd like to leave you with
this thought: Sometimes things become cliches because they're true[^5]. Nothing
exists in a vacuum, find the others and try to create joy.

[^1]: This time the rod that holds the bulb completely snapped off inside the lever and if I can't find the same exact assembly as before I'm going to have to replace the whole thing again. Our hard water eats this cheap chromed metal like it's sugar. Whatever happened to quality products?
[^2]: Or worse, being perceived to be wrong when I'm not.
[^3]: Whatever that means.
[^4]: Even some of our greaters admit they only did it by "standing on the shoulders of giants," or reminding us that "no man is an island."
[^5]: Or at least true enough.
