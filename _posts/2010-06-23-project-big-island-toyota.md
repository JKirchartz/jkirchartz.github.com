Big Island Toyota has always been a little ahead of the curve on social media, They're involved with their community, and they use their website pro-actively. Here are 2 requested projects from them.

Here is the [YouTube page](http://bigislandtoyota.com/youtube.cfm) from their
website. This was made with Coldfusion & JQuery. The Coldfusion parses their
YouTube RSS feed, JQuery is used to show each video in a simple LightBox.

They also requested a [blog](http://bigislandtoyota.com/Auto_Blog.cfm), which
I developed with ColdFusion & SQL. The front-end is a standard Content-
oriented design, with a contact link & links to share their posts around the
web. The Back-end is just as simple to use, it uses the
[FCKeditor](http://ckeditor.com/) (now renamed CKeditor) for Coldfusion to
provide a rich-text editor. There is also an RSS feed for the blog, although I
no longer have the access I need to find it.
