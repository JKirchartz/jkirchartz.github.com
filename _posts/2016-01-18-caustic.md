Here's a collection of actual songs I made using [Caustic](http://www.singlecellsoftware.com/caustic), and painstakingly exported to `*.wav`,  and uploaded to soundcloud directly from my smart phone.<!--more-->
These have been mastered on the internal speaker of my phone, I may update these tracks after trying them with some headphones and seeing how they really sound, but until then enjoy!
