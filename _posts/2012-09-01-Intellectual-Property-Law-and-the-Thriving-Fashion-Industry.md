Patents were an excellent idea, write out how you did something new and different, and
you could register for a limited monopopoly on that development. After your monopoly ran out
others could then look at your patent and come up with new ideas using your old work.

Now though patents aren't used for diseminating information, but to keep it a secret, and
to lock out your competition. As Apple did in it's recent case against Samsung. Apple is
afraid of competition, that's why they're trying to pass injuntions anywhere Samsung's
products are going to market.

The fashion industry doesn't have patents, you can't patent a t-shirt or a necklace. 
This hasn't destroyed the industry but caused it to thrive
