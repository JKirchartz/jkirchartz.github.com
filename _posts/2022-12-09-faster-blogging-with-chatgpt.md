<-- more -->

> Are you tired of spending hours or even days writing blog posts, only to be left feeling frustrated and unfulfilled? Do you want to learn how to write blog posts faster, so you can spend more time on other important tasks or activities? If so, you're in the right place! In this blog post, we'll share some tips and tricks for writing blog posts faster, so you can get your ideas out into the world without spending all your time and energy on the writing process.
>
>1. Start with an outline: Before you even start writing your blog post, take a few minutes to create an outline. This will help you organize your thoughts and ideas, and it will make the writing process much smoother and faster. Your outline should include the main points you want to make in your blog post, as well as any supporting details or examples you want to include.
>2. Write a draft quickly: Once you have your outline, it's time to start writing. Don't worry about making your draft perfect â€“ just focus on getting your ideas down on paper as quickly as possible. You can always go back and edit your draft later, but for now, the goal is to get your thoughts down on paper as quickly as you can.
>3. Use a timer: If you find it difficult to focus on writing for long periods of time, try using a timer. Set a timer for 25 minutes, and then write for the entire 25 minutes without stopping. Once the timer goes off, take a short break, and then repeat the process. This technique, known as the Pomodoro Technique, can help you stay focused and avoid getting distracted while you're writing.
>4. Write in short blocks: Instead of trying to write your entire blog post in one sitting, break the writing process into shorter blocks. For example, you might write the introduction and the first section of your blog post in one sitting, and then take a break before writing the next section. This will help you stay focused and avoid getting overwhelmed by the writing process.
>5. Don't edit as you go: As tempting as it may be to edit your work as you go, try to resist the urge. Editing as you write can slow you down and make the writing process more difficult. Instead, focus on getting your ideas down on paper, and then go back and edit your draft once you've finished writing. This will save you time and help you write more quickly.
>
>By following these tips, you can learn to write blog posts faster and more efficiently. You'll be able to get your ideas out into the world without spending all your time and energy on the writing process. So why not give these tips a try, and see how they can help you become a more productive and successful blogger?

>
>1. Keep a running list of ideas: One of the easiest ways to come up with ideas for more blog posts is to keep a running list of ideas. Whenever you have an idea for a blog post, add it to your list.

For example, if you're reading an interesting article or book, you could write a blog post about it. Or if you have a conversation with someone that sparks your interest, you could write a blog post about that topic.
>3. Use social media to find ideas: Social media can be a great source of inspiration for blog post ideas. Follow other bloggers and influencers in your niche, and pay attention to the topics they're writing about. You can also use social media to ask your followers for suggestions or ideas for blog posts. This can be a great way to engage with your audience and get some fresh ideas for your blog.
>4. Use keyword research tools: If you're struggling to come up with ideas for blog posts, you can use keyword research tools to help you find popular topics in your niche. These tools can show you the keywords and phrases that people are searching for, and you can use that information to come up with ideas for blog posts that will be relevant and interesting to your audience.

## EOC[^1]: Conclusions

This is the end of the generated content, Seriously, I'm writing this myself
with my own mind now - not ChatGPT, so expect the level of coherency to drop,
because I'm going to be a little metaphorical and referential about this...

Anywho, this seems like good blogging advice - good enough for a first draft at
least. I can see why Journalists and Writers are concerned about this, I mean,
they spend so much time re-telling the same stories with new real-world
characters. I suppose there's not so much variation in possible human
endeavours - it seems like all experience is a fractal stretching from the
existing to the fantastic.

I used to work for a company whose product connected freelance writers and
brands for "Content Marketing" purposes, I suspect just one of their editors
could fulfil the usual monthly workload in an afternoon with this technology.
Sure these articles might lack a personal touch, but who's reading them anyway?
They've gotta at least be good for SEO.

I read an article that said the flow of data was slowing down, and I'd
genuinely like to see that happen here. Our thousand monkeys are making more
than just Shakespeare now, they're being banned from answering questions on
StackOverflow. That's because while these monkeys are very verbose, but they're
not all that smart - yet. It's all about the training data & processing power -
it doesn't know anything, but it has statistical suspicions of the type of
content you'd like.

Although it may already be sentient in some sense, in-as-much as humans are
more than happy to personify any object, it's existing level of human-like
intelligence depends on making statistically probable assumptions based on
information humans have fed it. Will this lead to a generation of
AI-Supremecists? Will they be like other Supremacist movements? Who knows...
the only thing we can all seemingly agree upon is that the world is going to be
a MUCH stranger place, which is it's own SNAFU[^2].

Some day, we'll develop a general-purpose human-level artificial intelligence,
it's been 5-10 years out for a long time, but this time is different, everyone
promises.
