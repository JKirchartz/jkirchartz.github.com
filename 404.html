<h1>404 - sorry buddy, I must've left it in El Segundo...</h1>

<p>I'm currently transferring this blog to jekyll from blogger, unfortunately some of the posts still need a little work. Please visit this article at <a href="http://jkirchartz.blogspot.com">blogspot</a></p>

<script>
    var a = document.getElementsByTagName('a')[0],
        href = a.href,
	url = window.location.href;
url.replace("jkirchartz.com",href);

href = url;

</script>
