Welcome to Joel Kirchartz's Jekyll blog, eventually this will become 
my primary blog, after I figure out a few things to maintain backwards compatability.
</p>
<p>
I'm very excited to start writing my posts with markdown and vim, it's so much easier to use
than a GUI'd text editor.

<div class="blog-index">  
      {% assign post = site.posts.first %}
      {% assign content = post.content %}
      {% include post_detail.html %}
  </div>
<ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
        <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
