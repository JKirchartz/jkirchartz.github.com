  <p>Hello, my name is Joel <span data-IPA="kər·chärtz">Kirchartz</a>. I like to make stuff and share it with
    people on the web.</p>
  <p>I'm an autodidactic polyglot programmer living in Pittsburgh, Pa. I solve
    problems online for a living, but also enjoy creating art, music, and
    electronics, working on my voice &amp; making weird sounds with my mouth,
    practicing various circus skills, feats of prestiditation, and legerdemain.
    Learning new things is fun.</p>
        </p>I'm a full-stack developer and web generalist who has spent the last 15
        years crafting technological solutions for clients at Google and American
        Eagle. I'm passionate about modular web design, automation, and system
        development. I'm also a graduate of the Art Institute of Pittsburgh with a
        Bachelors of Science in Interactive Multimedia Design.</p>
<p>I've spent most
of my time developing solutions for small businesses and startups, most
recently for <a href="http://firemancreative.com">Fireman Creative</a>, <a
        href="http://google.com">Google</a>, <a
        href="http://BrandingBrand.com">BrandingBrand</a>, and <a
        href="http://www.skyword.com">Skyword</a>. I'm familiar with PHP,
Python, Coldfusion, Java, Javascript, Actionscript, Shell scripting, HTML and
CSS, and any other language you need.  My favorite text editor is <a
        href="http://vim.org">vim</a>, if you're interested in how my rig is
setup check out my <a

have a wonderful family. My wife, son, and daughter are the three most amazing
people in my life, I don't know how I'd be able to continue without their love
and support.</p> </article>
