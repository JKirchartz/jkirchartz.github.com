  <p>Hello, my name is Joel <span data-IPA="kər·chärtz">Kirchartz</a>. I like to make stuff and share it with
    people on the web.</p>
  <p>I'm an autodidactic polyglot programmer living in Pittsburgh, Pa. I solve
    problems online for a living, but also enjoy creating art, music, and
    electronics, working on my voice &amp; making weird sounds with my mouth,
    practicing various circus skills, feats of prestiditation, and legerdemain.
    Learning new things is fun.</p>
  <p>I've spent most of my time developing solutions for small businesses and startups,
    most recently for <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>, <a
      href="http://BrandingBrand.com">BrandingBrand</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.skyword.com">Skyword</a>. I'm familiar with PHP, Python, Coldfusion, Java, Javascript, Actionscript,
    Shell scripting, HTML and CSS, and any other language you need.
    My favorite text editor is <a href="http://vim.org">vim</a>, if you're interested
    in how my rig is setup check out my
    <a href="http://github.com/jkirchartz/dotfiles/">dotfiles</a>.</p>
  <p>I have a wonderful family. My wife, son, and daughter are the three most amazing people in
    my life, I don't know how I'd be able to continue without their love and support.</p>
