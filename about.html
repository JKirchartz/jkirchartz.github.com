    <p>Hello, my name is Joel <span data-IPA="kər·chärtz">Kirchartz</a>. I like to make stuff and share it with 
       people on the web.<p>
    <p>I'm a web developer located in Pittsburgh, Pa. I also enjoy making art, 
       music, and electronics and practicing various circus skills &amp; feats 
       of prestiditation. Learning new things is fun.</p>
    <p>I've spent most of my time developing solutions for small businesses and startups, 
        most recently for <a href="http://songwhale.com">Songwhale</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.skyword.com">Skyword</a>. I'm a self-taught polyglot programmer, 
        I've worked with PHP, Python, Coldfusion, Java, and Javascript, html and css. My
        favorite editor is <a href="http://vim.org">vim</a>, if you're interested
        in how my rig is setup check out my 
        <a href="http://github.com/jkirchartz/dotfiles/">dotfiles</a>.</p>
    <p>I have a wonderful family. My wife and son are the two most amazing people in
        my life, I don't know how I'd be able to do it all without their support.</p>
