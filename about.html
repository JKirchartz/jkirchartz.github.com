          Hello, I'm Joel <span data-IPA="kər·chärtz">Kirchartz</a>. I like to make
          stuff and share it with people on the web.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          I'm a full-stack developer and web generalist living in Pittsburgh, Pa.
          I'm passionate about modular web design &amp; development, automation,
          and developing systems.  I graduated from the Art Institute of Pittsburgh
          with a Bachelors of Science in Interactive Multimedia Design.  I've spent
          the last 15 years creating solutions for small businesses and startups,
          most recently for <a href="http://garrisonhughes.com">Garrison Hughes</a>, <a href="http://barkleyREI.com">Barkley REI</a>, <a href="http://firemancreative.com">Fireman
            Creative</a>, and <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>.  I primarily work
          with Python or Javascript, but I'm also familiar with PHP, Coldfusion,
          Java, Actionscript, Shell scripting, HTML and CSS, and any other language
          you need.  My favorite text editor is <a href="http://vim.org">vim</a>,
          if you're interested in how my rig is setup (at the momement) check out my <a

          I solve problems online for a living, but also enjoy creating art, music,
          and electronics, working on my voice &amp; making weird sounds with my
          mouth and anything I can find, practicing various circus skills,
          feats of prestidigitation and legerdemain, and a bit of baking.  Learning new things is fun.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          I love going on adventures with my family; my wife, son, and daughter are the three
          most amazing people in my world, I wouldn't be able to continue following
          my passions without their unconditional love and support.
        </p>
