  <p class="card-text">Hello, my name is Joel <span data-IPA="kər·chärtz">Kirchartz</a>. I like to make stuff and share it with
    people on the web.</p>
  <p class="card-text">I'm a full-stack developer and web generalist living in Pittsburgh, Pa.  I'm passionate about modular web design, automation, and system development. I solve
    problems online for a living, but also enjoy creating art, music, and
    electronics, working on my voice &amp; making weird sounds with my mouth,
    practicing various circus skills, feats of prestiditation, and legerdemain.
    Learning new things is fun.</p>
<p class="card-text">I'm a graduate of the Art Institute of Pittsburgh with a Bachelors of Science in Interactive Multimedia Design.
I've spent the last 15 years developing solutions for small businesses and startups, most
recently for <a href="http://firemancreative.com">Fireman Creative</a>, <a
        href="http://google.com">Google</a>, and <a
        href="http://BrandingBrand.com">BrandingBrand</a>. I'm familiar with PHP,
Python, Coldfusion, Java, Javascript, Actionscript, Shell scripting, HTML and
CSS, and any other language you need.  My favorite text editor is <a

<p class="card-text">I
have a wonderful family. My wife, son, and daughter are the three most amazing
people in my life, I don't know how I'd be able to continue without their love
and support.</p>
