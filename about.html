      Hello, I'm Joel <span data-IPA="kər·chärtz">Kirchartz</a>. I like to make
      stuff and share it with people on the web.

    <p class="card-text">
      I'm a full-stack developer and web generalist living in Pittsburgh, Pa.
      I'm passionate about modular web design &amp; development, automation,
      and developing systems.  I graduated from the Art Institute of Pittsburgh
      with a Bachelors of Science in Interactive Multimedia Design.  I've spent
      the last 15 years creating solutions for small businesses and startups,
      most recently for <a href="http://firemancreative.com">Fireman
        Creative</a>, <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>, and <a
        href="http://BrandingBrand.com">BrandingBrand</a>.  I primarily work
      with Python or Javascript, but I'm also familiar with PHP, Coldfusion,
      Java, Actionscript, Shell scripting, HTML and CSS, and any other language
      you need.  My favorite text editor is <a href="http://vim.org">vim</a>,

      I solve problems online for a living, but also enjoy creating art, music,
      and electronics, working on my voice &amp; making weird sounds with my
      mouth, practicing various circus skills, feats of prestidigitation, and
      legerdemain.  Learning new things is fun.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      I love going on adventures my wife, son, and daughter; they are the three
      most amazing people in my world, I wouldn't be able to continue following
      my passions without their love and support.
