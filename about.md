### Hello, I'm Joel <span data-IPA="kər·chärtz">Kirchartz</a>. I like to make stuff and share it with people on the web.

I'm a full-stack developer and web generalist living in Pittsburgh, Pa.  I'm
passionate about modular web design &amp; development, automation, and
developing systems.  I graduated from the Art Institute of Pittsburgh with a
Bachelors of Science in Interactive Multimedia Design.  I've spent the last 15
years creating solutions for small businesses and startups, most recently for
[Garrison Hughes](http://garrisonhughes.com), [Barkley REI](http://barkleyREI.com), [Fireman Creative](http://firemancreative.com),
and [Google](http://google.com).  I primarily work with WordPress or Javascript,
but I'm also familiar with Python, PHP, Coldfusion, Java, Actionscript, Shell
scripting, HTML and CSS, and just about any other language or framework you need.  My favorite text
editor is [vim](http://vim.org), if you're interested in how my rig is setup
(at the momement) check out my [dotfiles](http://github.com/jkirchartz/dotfiles/).

I solve problems online for a living, but also enjoy creating art, music, and
electronics, working on my voice &amp; making weird sounds with my mouth and
anything I can find, practicing various circus skills, feats of
prestidigitation and legerdemain, and a bit of baking.  Learning new things is
fun.

I love going on adventures with my family; my wife, son, and daughter are the
three most amazing people in my world, I wouldn't be able to continue following
my passions without their unconditional love and support.
